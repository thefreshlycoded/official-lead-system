    {"@context": "https://schema.org/","@type": "FAQPage","mainEntity":[{"@type": "Question","name": "How do videos get into YouTube Kids?","acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer","text": "YouTube Kids is a filtered version of YouTube, built just for kids to explore their interests in a contained, age-appropriate experience. We work to [identify content that is age-appropriate](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/10938174), adheres to our [quality principles](https://support.google.com/youtube/?p=best_practices_kids), and is diverse enough to meet the varied interests of kids globally. In order to find a variety of the best family-friendly videos from the broader universe of content on YouTube, we use a mix of automated filters built by our engineering teams, human review, and feedback from users (more details below).For a channel or video to be included in the YouTube Kids app, the content must be family-friendly. Check out our [Creating for YouTube Kids Field Guide](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/www.youtube.com/en//intl/th/go/family/static/pdfs/creating-for-youtube-kids-fieldguide.pdf), designed to help creators create programming that will be eligible for inclusion in YouTube Kids, like videos that foster positive interests, promote development and education, and inspire families to engage with each other and the real world."}},{"@type": "Question","name": "There are videos on YouTube that I think my kid will enjoy, but I can’t find them in the YouTube Kids app. Can I share these to YouTube Kids?","acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer","text": "Yes. When you sign in to YouTube with the Google Account that has set up YouTube Kids for your child, your parent account can share videos directly from YouTube into YouTube Kids. Follow the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&amp;v=eVYsgC7-6ZM&amp;feature=emb_logo&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;steps here&lt;/a&gt;."}},{"@type": "Question","name": "How do automated filters work?","acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer","text": "YouTube Kids is a filtered version of YouTube, built just for kids to explore their interests in a contained, age-appropriate experience. For a channel or video to be included in the YouTube Kids app, the content must first be deemed to be family-friendly by automated filters (in addition to feedback from users and some human review).This means that our automated filters scan multiple aspects of the video including thumbnails, titles and the actual content of the video. For example, if a video thumbnail features any inappropriate imagery, or if the video title includes profanity, or if the content of the video features a mature theme, these would not be eligible for YouTube Kids. Additionally, if there is a trend happening on the main YouTube app that is unsuitable for kids, we work quickly to update our automated filters to prevent any of that content from getting into YouTube Kids. We work hard to exclude content that’s not suitable for kids, but we can’t manually review every single video and no automated system of filters is perfect. If you find something you believe is inappropriate for YouTube Kids, you can flag it for fast review. This makes the app better for everyone. Flagged videos are reviewed 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and will be removed from the YouTube Kids app for all users if deemed inappropriate after review. Learn more about [flagging videos](https://support.google.com/youtubekids/answer/6130562). And because no two families are the same and parents have different views on what suitable content is for their kids, you can customize the YouTube Kids app experience even more by [blocking videos or channels](https://support.google.com/youtubekids/answer/7178746) that you decide are personally unsuitable for your family."}},{"@type": "Question","name": "Do automated filters get updated?","acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer","text": "Our engineering teams work with our human reviewer teams to continuously ensure the automated filters are working as intended. Human reviewers double-check the decisions made by automated filters by sampling videos. If there’s an error, our engineers use that information to refine the automated filters. The human reviewer teams also use videos flagged by parents as another checkpoint to ensure the automated filters are working correctly."}},{"@type": "Question","name": "Who decides what content is eligible to be on YouTube Kids?","acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer","text": "The YouTube Kids team has developed a set of [quality principles](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/10774223) and [content policies](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/10938174) to help guide which videos are eligible to be a part of the YouTube Kids app. This work is further informed by feedback from parents and through consulting with a variety of external specialists in child development, children’s media, and digital learning and citizenship. Our automated filters, which take these efforts into account, then identify family-friendly content for inclusion in the app. The YouTube Kids team also programs content for five categories (e.g. Learning, Shows, Explore, Music, and Gaming) on the homepage of YouTube Kids."}},{"@type": "Question","name": "What is the difference between flagging and blocking?","acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer","text": "Flagging is a way to indicate that you believe a video on YouTube Kids is inappropriate for all users and want it to be reviewed for potential removal from the app. Flagged videos are reviewed 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and will be removed from the YouTube Kids app for all users if deemed inappropriate after review. Learn more about [flagging videos](https://support.google.com/youtubekids/answer/6130562).Blocking is a way for you to remove content you don’t like for your family, based on your personal preferences. When you block a video or channel, your kids will no longer see that content in the YouTube Kids apps when you are signed in. Learn more about [blocking videos](https://support.google.com/youtubekids/answer/7178746)."}},{"@type": "Question","name": "How do video recommendations work?","acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer","text": "Videos are recommended on the app’s home screen based on what your kids watch and search for as they use the app. Recommendations are drawn from all the videos available in YouTube Kids excluding content you have flagged or blocked. The recommendations are selected by our automated systems without human review. When you’re a new user, we don’t show recommendations until we have learned enough of what kinds of content you enjoy watching."}},{"@type": "Question","name": "My child enjoys watching toy unboxing, family vlogging and/or let’s play gaming videos. What should I think about these videos?","acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer","text": "YouTube Kids has videos across a wide variety of topics. According to experts, there are benefits to content that models imaginative play or problem solving, or vlogs where families share personal experiences. However, some parents may feel concerns about content that may have commercial elements or language used by gamers (profanity is restricted on YouTube Kids). If you see things you’d prefer your kids not to watch you can [block videos or channels or limit YouTube Kids to only videos or channels that you have approved](/kids/parent-resources/)."}},{"@type": "Question","name": "I heard about the “Momo challenge.” As a YouTube Kids user, should I be worried about it?","acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer","text": "The “Momo challenge” was a story circulated on the internet in early 2019. For more details, you can visit this article from the BBC, “[Momo challenge: Why it isn&#39;t real and you don&#39;t need to worry](https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/47402709)”.Content encouraging harmful and dangerous challenges are strictly against our [Community Guidelines](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2801964). The Momo character is not allowed on the YouTube Kids app and we have safeguards in place to exclude it from the app. YouTube is a company made up of parents and families and we’re personally committed to protecting you and your family."}},{"@type": "Question","name": "What parental control options do I have when using YouTube Kids?","acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer","text": "YouTube Kids has a full suite of parental controls in the app so you can customize your kid’s experience. You can create individual profiles for each of your kids, decide what content to make available for your kids, set a timer to limit screen time, see recent videos your kids have been watching, and so much more. [Learn more](/kids/parent-resources/)."}},{"@type": "Question","name": "Can I limit screen time in YouTube Kids?","acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer","text": "Our built-in timer lets parents limit screen time by telling kids when it’s time to stop watching. The timer will display a friendly alert and stop the app when the session is over, so you don’t have to. [Learn more](/kids/parent-resources/)."}},{"@type": "Question","name": "Are there paid advertisements on YouTube Kids?","acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer","text": "We allow limited paid advertisements (“paid ads”) in the app so that we can offer it for free to all families to enjoy. All paid ads must be in strict compliance with our advertising policies, are clearly marked as advertisements and are only approved to be shown on YouTube Kids if they are family-friendly. [Learn more](https://support.google.com/youtubekids/answer/6130541).We [do not allow](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/10938174) content with paid product placements or endorsements on YouTube Kids. Overly commercial content is also not allowed, which includes:- Traditional advertisements for products and services uploaded by creators or brands- Content that incites the viewer to buy a product- Videos focused on product packaging- Videos focused on the excessive accumulation or consumption of products"}},{"@type": "Question","name": "Is there an option to watch YouTube Kids without any paid advertisements?","acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer","text": "Yes!

Learn more about [flagging videos](https://support.google.com/youtubekids/answer/6130562)."}},{"@type": "Question","name": "I want to create content for families. Do you have any resources?","acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer","text": "Yes!There are two resources available for those interested in creating for our youngest users. Our [Best Practices For Kids &amp; Family Content](https://services.google.com/fh/files/helpcenter/best_practices_for_kids_and_family_content_en.pdf) is designed to help you create programming that will be eligible for inclusion in YouTube Kids and resonate with family and kid audiences.

                      <p>YouTube Kids is a filtered version of YouTube, built just for kids to explore their interests in a contained, age-appropriate experience. For a channel or video to be included in the YouTube Kids app, the content must first be deemed to be family-friendly by automated filters (in addition to feedback from users and some human review).</p>
<p>This means that our automated filters scan multiple aspects of the video including thumbnails, titles and the actual content of the video. For example, if a video thumbnail features any inappropriate imagery, or if the video title includes profanity, or if the content of the video features a mature theme, these would not be eligible for YouTube Kids. Additionally, if there is a trend happening on the main YouTube app that is unsuitable for kids, we work quickly to update our automated filters to prevent any of that content from getting into YouTube Kids. </p>
<p>We work hard to exclude content that’s not suitable for kids, but we can’t manually review every single video and no automated system of filters is perfect. If you find something you believe is inappropriate for YouTube Kids, you can flag it for fast review. This makes the app better for everyone. Flagged videos are reviewed 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and will be removed from the YouTube Kids app for all users if deemed inappropriate after review. Learn more about <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" href="https://support.google.com/youtubekids/answer/6130562">flagging videos</a>. And because no two families are the same and parents have different views on what suitable content is for their kids, you can customize the YouTube Kids app experience even more by <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" href="https://support.google.com/youtubekids/answer/7178746">blocking videos or channels</a> that you decide are personally unsuitable for your family.</p>

                      <p>YouTube Kids has videos across a wide variety of topics. According to experts, there are benefits to content that models imaginative play or problem solving, or vlogs where families share personal experiences. However, some parents may feel concerns about content that may have commercial elements or language used by gamers (profanity is restricted on YouTube Kids). If you see things you’d prefer your kids not to watch you can <a href="/kids/parent-resources/">block videos or channels or limit YouTube Kids to only videos or channels that you have approved</a>.</p>
