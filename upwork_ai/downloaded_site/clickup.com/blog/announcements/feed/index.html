<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Times have changed. The way we work hasn&#8217;t—and it&#8217;s about time it did.</em></h3>



<p>When <strong>Slack launched in 2014, it sparked a revolution</strong>. Distributed teams collaborated faster, conversations flourished, and at least the perception of productivity skyrocketed.</p>



<p>But a decade later, we all know we <strong>pay a hefty price for the communication style</strong> that Slack and similar platforms introduced.</p>



<p>Despite advancements in work management, <strong>chat apps remain isolated</strong>, disconnected from the tools we use to collaborate, manage, and create. Even though Microsoft Teams has &#8220;tabs,&#8221; the tabs themselves might as well be separate—they&#8217;re only<strong> superficially stitched together</strong>.</p>



<p>We’re constantly <strong>overwhelmed with noise</strong>—switching between windows, dodging distractions, and trying to stay organized amid endless pings. It’s impossible to focus and unrealistic to keep everything in order when we’re <strong>forced to toggle between apps</strong>, chatting in one place and managing work in another.</p>



<p>At ClickUp, we’ve always believed the solution was simple: <strong>our conversations and work should live in the same platform</strong>. This creates unparalleled productivity, clarity, and focus.</p>



<p>That’s why we’re beyond excited to introduce <strong>ClickUp Chat</strong>.</p>



<p>ClickUp Chat allows you to have work-related <strong>conversations directly alongside your tasks, projects, and resources, natively integrated</strong> into your workflow.</p>



<p><strong>We didn’t just create another chat app</strong>—we completely redefined how teams collaborate, crafting a cutting-edge communication <strong>tool designed to define work for the next decade</strong>.</p>



<div class="wistia_responsive_padding" style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><div class="wistia_responsive_wrapper" style="height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;width:100%;"><iframe src="https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/bktuluhie6?seo=true&#038;videoFoam=true" title="ClickUp Chat Video" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" class="wistia_embed" name="wistia_embed" msallowfullscreen width="100%" height="100%"></iframe></div></div>
<script src="https://fast.wistia.net/assets/external/E-v1.js" async></script



<p></p>



<p>Chat combines <strong>everything you love about chat with fundamentally new functionality</strong> to help you work smarter and faster.&nbsp;Chat in ClickUp also harnesses the power of ClickUp's Brain<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> AI to clean up Chats, find action items, create tasks, and even automatically answer questions before anyone on your team has to answer them manually. It's remarkably <strong>revolutionary</strong>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Work from Chat</h2>



<p>Now, you can do your work right when (and where) you're discussing it. We've totally converged chat with project management, to provide unparalleled productivity.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Projects in Chat:</strong> Our Chats aren’t just for conversation—they also have <strong>Lists, Projects, Tasks, Docs, Forms, Whiteboards, and more.</strong></li>



<li><strong>FollowUps<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />:</strong> Conversations commonly get flooded with noise, and important messages get lost. Triage messages and ensure action items never get lost with FollowUps.</li>



<li><strong>Convert messages into tasks</strong> <strong>(with AI)</strong>: Turn any conversation into a task. You can do this yourself, or let AI capture the context from the thread and package it perfectly for execution.</li>



<li><strong>SyncUps:</strong> Communicate through live video and audio calls, right inside your Workspace. You can share your screen, link to tasks inside the SyncUps chat, assign comments on the call, and more. Plus, AI can automatically post a summary and create action items from the call.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Context Always Stays Connected</h2>



<p>One shared platform means a single source of truth; all of the context is finally in one place. We automatically draw relationships to similar Chats and tasks, so you don't have to manually link context anymore.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Connected Tasks: </strong>Link messages with tasks and keep the context tied together.</li>



<li><strong>Synced Threads:</strong> Keep threads synced between Chats and tasks, so, no matter where the conversation happens, everyone stays on the same page.</li>



<li><strong>Relationships</strong>: Tasks or Docs mentioned in Chats are automatically linked, so you can see all of the conversations related to those assets, and all of the assets related to those conversations.</li>



<li><strong>Posts:</strong> Create longer-form, async-driven content in Chat threads, and label them as Updates, Announcements, or Ideas. Knowing that important conversations are captured in one place, you can slow down and focus on deep work instead of working in fear that you're missing critical information.</li>



<li><strong>Teammate Profiles &amp; Scheduling: </strong>See teammates' priorities and even book a meeting on their calendar, right inside Chat.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">AI Manages Chat for You</h2>



<p>With all your work in one place, AI can now do things that used to be impossible, like automatically answering questions before humans on your team have to.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>AI Answers</strong>: Ask a question in any Chat and AI will give you an instant answer, based on the entire history of that Chat—or, based on information throughout your Workspace and Connected Apps (Google Drive, GitHub, Figma, Salesforce, etc.)</li>



<li><strong>AI CatchUp</strong>: When you get to work, use AI CatchUp to see what you missed. Instead of going Chat by Chat and reading every single message, AI catches you up with the important topics and anything you need to take action on.</li>



<li><strong>AI Task Creation</strong>: One click to create a task from a message, and AI will automatically write the name, description, and link to the Chat context.</li>



<li><strong>AI Relationships</strong>: Instantly find any tasks, docs, or other Chats related to the Chat message or thread you're looking at.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Plus Everything You'd Expect from Chat Today</h2>



<p>And of course, we've got every other feature you've grown to expect from team messaging apps, like:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Direct Messages:</strong> Create 1:1 or group conversations with specific people.</li>



<li><strong>Chats &amp; Channels:</strong> Set up an area for conversation for any Space, Folder, or List, or create a new Space for Chats that aren't attached to anything else.</li>



<li><strong>Threads:</strong> Nested conversations to keep your Chats tidy.</li>



<li><strong>A Customizable Sidebar:</strong> Organize your Chats your way, including sections that you can personalize.</li>



<li><strong>An Activity Feed:</strong> Quickly see updates across all your Chats, including tabs for Mentions, Reactions, and Assigned to Me.</li>



<li><strong>Customizable Push Notifications:</strong> Choose your own preferences for each Chat and even specific messages.</li>



<li><strong>Reminders: </strong>Get notified, so you can come back to any message.</li>



<li><strong>Drafts &amp; Sent</strong>: Quickly find anything you've written (or are writing).</li>



<li><strong>Integrations:</strong> Link to dozens of top apps to expand what Chat can do.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Delivering Our Vision: The Everything App for Work</h2>



<p>Today, our original vision to <strong>unify communication and work management</strong> is finally a reality.</p>



<p>ClickUp Chat is <strong>the future of work</strong>—<strong>flawlessly fusing communication with your tools</strong> and workflows. It's where conversations, tasks, and projects don’t just connect—<strong>they converge</strong>.</p>



<p>By bringing communication and work together in one place—with the power of AI—ClickUp Chat unlocks <strong>unprecedented productivity.</strong></p>



<p>Let's <strong>make the world more productive</strong>, with Chat and Work (finally) together.</p>



<p>﻿<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f49c.png" alt="💜" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />﻿ Zeb</p>

<p>At ClickUp, our mission is to revolutionize the way teams work, making every process more streamlined, efficient, and intuitive. <strong>Today, we&#8217;re thrilled to unveil the latest innovation in our suite of powerful tools: Connected AI,</strong> a groundbreaking feature within ClickUp Brain.</p>



<p>Connected AI goes beyond search; it&#8217;s about transforming the information within them into actionable insights for faster, smarter decision-making.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-enter-clickup%E2%80%99s-connected-ai">Enter ClickUp’s Connected AI</h2>



<p>Connected AI is our answer to the chaos of fragmented workflows. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>It&#8217;s not just another feature; it&#8217;s a revolutionary approach to how we work. Connected AI centralizes your data, making it easily searchable and accessible.</p>



<div class="wp-block-clickup-clickup-author-quote cu-author-quote undefined"><blockquote class="cu-author-quote__quote"><p>Connected AI isn&#8217;t just about finding files; it&#8217;s about unlocking infinite intelligence empowering teams to 10x productivity by automating end-to-end workflows.</p></blockquote><figure class="cu-author-quote__author-group"><img id="13061" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="cu-author-quote__image" width="366" height="366" src="https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/screenshot-www.canva_.com-2020.11.27-16_29_49.png" alt="zeb evans" srcset="https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/screenshot-www.canva_.com-2020.11.27-16_29_49.png 366w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/screenshot-www.canva_.com-2020.11.27-16_29_49-300x296.png 300w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/screenshot-www.canva_.com-2020.11.27-16_29_49-150x150.png 150w" sizes="50px"/><figcaption class="cu-author-quote__author-info"><cite class="cu-author-quote__author-name">Zeb Evans</cite><span>, </span><span class="cu-author-quote__author-position">CEO and Founder at ClickUp</span></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Connected AI integrates all your tools in one place, ensuring that all your knowledge is accessible and actionable, no matter where it&#8217;s stored.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-solving-the-challenge-of-fragmented-workflows">Solving the Challenge of Fragmented Workflows</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s no secret that our modern workplace is a complex web of tools and platforms.</p>



<p>We use different applications for communication, project management, file storage, and more. This fragmentation creates silos of information, making it challenging to find what we need when we need it. The constant switching between apps—often referred to as the <strong>“toggle tax”</strong>—further hampers our productivity.</p>



<p><strong>And the tax is real:</strong> <a href="https://hbr.org/2022/08/how-much-time-and-energy-do-we-waste-toggling-between-applications">a recent study by HBR</a> revealed that workers toggle between apps <em>1,200 times a day.</em> That&#8217;s just under 4 hours a week in attention resetting, or 9% of workers&#8217; annual work time!</p>



<p><em>But what if there was a way to bring all these scattered pieces together and eliminate the toggle tax?</em></p>



<p>What if AI could bridge the gaps, connect the dots, and transform our fragmented workflows into a seamless, integrated experience?</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-the-evolution-of-ai-in-the-workplace">The Evolution of AI in the Workplace</h3>



<p>The journey of AI in the workplace has been remarkable.</p>



<p>From disconnected AI solutions that operated independently from workflows, to point solutions that addressed specific tasks, we&#8217;ve seen significant advancements. </p>



<p>In 2023, ClickUp Brain 1.0 started integrating AI with core work processes, but with Connected AI, we are now tying everything together for the first time, ever.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-the-cutting-edge-technology-behind-clickup-brain-and-connected-ai">The Cutting-Edge Technology Behind ClickUp Brain and Connected AI</h3>



<p>Connected AI isn&#8217;t just another AI tool; it&#8217;s a groundbreaking technology that gives teams a unique edge by seamlessly integrating the most advanced AI capabilities directly into your workflow.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GIF_V06-1.gif" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Here&#8217;s what sets ClickUp Brain and Connected AI apart from other solutions on the market today:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Real-Time Data Updates:</strong> Unlike some other tools on the market, which can take hours to reflect changes, ClickUp Brain ensures that all changes within ClickUp and connected third-party apps are reflected instantly. This means you&#8217;re always working with the most up-to-date information without any delays.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Effortless Integration:</strong> ClickUp Brain seamlessly integrates with GDrive, Box, Dropbox, Confluence, and GitHub, among others. No manual configurations or third-party services are required—everything is connected and ready to go out of the box. ChatGPT, on the other hand, requires extensive manual setup and doesn&#8217;t natively index files, making it less efficient for integrated workflows.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Privacy and Security by Default:</strong> Your data privacy is paramount. ClickUp Brain only accesses information you can see and never uses your data to train AI models, unlike many other AI tools which require expensive enterprise plans for similar guarantees.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Comprehensive Context Awareness:</strong> ClickUp Brain understands the full context of your work by deeply integrating with all aspects of your ClickUp Workspace—tasks, documents, and soon, chat. This deep integration allows for more precise and actionable insights. ChatGPT, in comparison, offers only surface-level search capabilities and lacks the context awareness necessary for deep workflow integration.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Advanced Productivity Features:</strong> ClickUp Brain goes beyond basic AI functionalities. It includes AI-powered writing tools, team reports, project updates, and more, all designed to save you time and enhance your workflow with just a click.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Connected AI is the next evolution in intelligence-powered work, providing a cohesive, powerful experience that transforms our daily work lives.</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-connected-ai-at-a-glance-how-it-transforms-your-roadblocks-into-new-efficiencies">Connected AI at a Glance: How It Transforms Your Roadblocks into New Efficiencies</h2>



<p>Managing multiple tools, platforms, and vast amounts of data can create significant roadblocks to efficiency. </p>



<p>ClickUp’s Connected AI is designed to turn these challenges into opportunities for faster information gathering, smarter decision making, and seamless action.</p>



<p>Here’s a quick overview of how Connected AI can transform your workflow:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="6-1-simplify-information-overload-"><strong>1. Simplify Information Overload</strong></h3>



<p>Finding specific information across multiple platforms can be a daunting task. Connected AI centralizes your data, making it easily searchable and accessible.</p>



<p>Now, all your critical information is at your fingertips.</p>



<p><em>Need to review key talking points from recent board decks? With Connected AI, you can <a href="https://clickup.com/blog/ai-document-summarizers/">generate a summary in seconds</a>, avoiding the hassle of searching through multiple documents.</em></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="7-2-find-anything-instantly-"><strong>2. Find Anything, Instantly</strong></h3>



<p>Connected AI works in real-time, providing instant access and insights.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="0-why-clickup-ai">Why ClickUp AI?</h2>
<p>We’ve seen massive advances in technology over the past 50 years. From the introduction of personal computers to the widespread adoption of the Internet and smartphones. Each leap has completely changed how people work—and AI will likely be the most transformative development yet.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-economic-potential-of-generative-ai-the-next-productivity-frontier#key-insights" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">new research</a> by McKinsey &amp; Company, AI could automate work activities that take up 60-70% of employees’ time. For professions like customer support, engineering, and marketing, that means their productivity could increase by as much as 45%.</p>
<p>The pace of progress is staggering, to say the least! New breakthroughs are announced every week, and the potential applications seem limitless. <strong>No matter your role, in the near future, you will use AI to help get your work done more <em>efficiently</em>. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f9be.png" alt="🦾" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></strong></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-clickup-ai-is-here-to-transform-your-work">ClickUp AI is Here to Transform Your Work</h2>
<p>Learning any new technology can be overwhelming, and when it comes to using AI, you <em>need</em> to be an expert in speaking its language to unlock true value.</p>
<p>AI can be particular about how you communicate with it. Even with a specific use case in mind, you need to be precise in how you ask for help by sharing the right context and setting the correct dials for tone and creativity.</p>
<p><strong>At ClickUp, we’ve made it significantly simpler and more intuitive to talk with AI.</strong> All of the pre-work has been done for you—all you have to do is open ClickUp to get started. You don’t have to leave where you work, <a href="/blog?p=56983">context switch</a>, or become an AI expert to see an immediate productivity boost and leverage its power in ways you hadn’t thought of before.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-custom-built-for-you">Custom-built for you</h3>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>ClickUp is leapfrogging the industry with three AI assistants designed to streamline work and save you time</em></p>
<p>San Diego, January 30, 2024 — Today, <a href="https://clickup.com/">ClickUp</a>, the productivity platform that brings work together in one place, announced ClickUp Brain, the next generation of <a href="https://clickup.com/ai">ClickUp AI</a>. ClickUp Brain is the first AI offering that pulls knowledge from across an entire organization’s workspace to eliminate work about work.  </p>
<p>ClickUp Brain is comprised of three distinct yet complimentary products: AI Knowledge Manager<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />, AI Project Manager<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />, and AI Writer for Work<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />. Together, they dramatically accelerate routine tasks, freeing you to focus your limited time on innovation and leadership.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI Knowledge Manager: </strong>Ask questions and get contextual and complete answers from your Docs, tasks, and projects. </li>
<li><strong>AI Project Manager:</strong> Manage and automate your work including progress reports, individual standups, and team updates. </li>
<li><strong>AI Writer for Work:</strong> Perfect your writing with role-based prompts, suited for your job’s specific needs.</li>
</ul>
<p>ClickUp Brain is the only productivity AI that pulls insights from everywhere that your work lives, including tasks, Docs, and Dashboards. While other writing assistants do basic generative AI with a skin on top of ChatGPT, AI Writer for Work uses its knowledge of your role and situational context to write brilliant content suited for the occasion.</p>
<p>ClickUp Brain is more accessible than ever. With a conversational interface, you can easily navigate to ClickUp Brain from anywhere in the platform and ask questions the way you would to a colleague. ClickUp Brain sits within your workstream, making it immediately available and eliminating the labor and time wasted toggling to another tool.</p>
<p>“At ClickUp, our mission has always been to save people time,” said Zeb Evans, CEO and Founder, ClickUp. “AI tools are everywhere, but none are saving you time through every step of your work day. ClickUp Brain is deeply embedded in the place you do work; it bridges the gaps and connects the dots across your work, your communication, and your knowledge. ClickUp Brain is here to save you time and eliminate work about work.”</p>
<p>“ClickUp Brain revolutionizes our workflow, enhancing weekly leadership updates with dynamic, detailed narratives,” said Phillip Quinlan, Head of Operational Innovation, University College of Dublin. “Its Docs feature streamlines meeting preparation, elevates content beyond mere one-liners, and the chat summary tool efficiently recaps important discussions for clarity and action. ClickUp Brain really is a new era of AI that truly makes an impact.”</p>
<p>ClickUp Brain is available now for all customers at just $5 per user per month.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Like a successful <a href="/blog?p=62632">project closure</a> or a no-surprises performance review, it’s time to move this year’s status from “In Progress” to “Done,” and reflect on some of 2024’s brightest moments.</p>
<p>Whether you remember it for Barbenheimer, the Kelce Bowl, Virgin Galactic, or just a whole lot of Taylor Swift—2024 was a doozy. And at ClickUp, that sentiment certainly rings true. </p>
<p>For us, 2024 will forever be the year we shocked even ourselves with our growth and productivity over the last 12 months. Starting off strong with <a href="https://clickup.com/events/levelup">LevelUp</a>, into the launch of <a href="https://clickup.com/features/ai">ClickUp AI</a>, countless <a href="https://dev-doc.clickup.com/333/d/h/ad-714989/87e9149504a8c51?_gl=1*2jgmlk*_gcl_aw*R0NMLjE3MDAwOTA0NjkuQ2p3S0NBaUE5ZEdxQmhBcUVpd0FtUnBUQ3lfOXdnS256bjdaRWQyZ1BGd2FNVVgyUkZuLWxuX2E2TU96MU1XTTlxbmt4R0o3anhfb2d4b0M0VG9RQXZEX0J3RQ..*_gcl_au*MTc1NzE0Njg2OS4xNjk1MDUxODk2">weekly releases</a>, and the much-anticipated roll-out of <a href="https://clickup.com/v3">ClickUp 3.0</a>—to say we’ve been busy is an understatement. </p>

<p>But before we settle down for our long winter’s nap, we’d be remiss not to acknowledge the people who continue to make all of this possible. Every feature, event, campaign, and change was inspired by and curated for the users, readers, and enthusiasts who share in our mission of saving time to focus on the things that matter most in our lives. Our dogs. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f49c.png" alt="💜" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Don’t be fooled by our love note of an intro—just as ClickUp’s not your average productivity platform, this isn’t your average end-of-year blog. Instead of running through a timeline of events, we wanted to polish off this year with something extra special (and just for you).</p>
<p>Introducing, our first-ever ClickUp WrapUp. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f381.png" alt="🎁" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="0-a-personalized-recap-of-your-productivity">A Personalized Recap of Your Productivity</h2>
<p>Your WrapUp is a data-driven deep dive into your year in ClickUp. It’s a reflection of the many ways you made ClickUp your own and our way of showing you that you didn’t just speak the good word of productivity in 2024, you lived it. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f389.png" alt="🎉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>We looked back on the number of times you interacted with some of our favorite features including <a href="https://clickup.com/features/tasks">tasks</a>, <a href="https://clickup.com/features/docs">Docs</a>, <a href="https://clickup.com/features/universalsearch">Search</a>, <a href="https://clickup.com/features/automations">Automations</a>, <a href="https://clickup.com/features">and more</a>. We then compared your profile against that of all of our users and “wrapped up” those findings into one of 20 different personas based on the way you used ClickUp—from The Perfectionist to the Emoji Connoisseur—each persona is an essential piece of a highly-efficient team.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img alt="WrapUp Profiles Revealed" class="wp-image-125190" decoding="async" height="891" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px" src="https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/WrapUp-Profiles-Revealed-1400x891.png" srcset="https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/WrapUp-Profiles-Revealed-1400x891.png 1400w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/WrapUp-Profiles-Revealed-300x191.png 300w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/WrapUp-Profiles-Revealed-768x489.png 768w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/WrapUp-Profiles-Revealed-1536x978.png 1536w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/WrapUp-Profiles-Revealed-700x446.png 700w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/WrapUp-Profiles-Revealed.png 1920w" width="1400"/></figure>

<p>Your WrapUp has nothing to do with <em>what</em> you used ClickUp for—it celebrates <em>how</em> you used it. So, if you created a plethora of private Lists and Docs for your kitchen renovation, personal diary, and PTA gossip—don’t worry, your secrets are still safe with us. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f60e.png" alt="😎" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>And now, to answer your final burning question—<strong><em>why did we do this?</em></strong></p>
<p>Well, for the most important reason of all. Some harmless, wholesome fun. </p>
<p>Generative AI took 2024 by storm and ushered in a new level of concerns regarding our personal data, safety, likeness, and digital comfortability. While we can likely all agree now that <a href="/blog?p=67740">AI tools</a> are just that—tools—and not after our well-being, why not use our powers for good and repackage some of our purely numerical data into something a little silly? </p>
<p>Before you run to your email inbox, bear in mind <strong>only the top percentage of ClickUp superusers will receive a WrapUp</strong>. But luckily, that’s still a whole lot of people. </p>
<p>If you don’t find a WrapUp email in your inbox this year, that doesn’t mean the fun is over. We’re sharing the key traits, patterns, and personalities that make each persona unique, and we’re confident you’ll find the one(s) that suit you best in the mix. </p>
<p>Make sure you’re first in line for your WrapUp results next year by signing up for ClickUp today, then lean on one of our <a href="https://clickup.com/wrapup">many resources</a> to discover new ways to take your work further in using ClickUp.</p>

<p>Compare your own findings against ours to see how your time-saving tendencies stack up against the majority of our users, then share your results with the other productivity enthusiasts in your life. You might even pick up a few new ClickUp tips and tricks in the process.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-unwrapping-the-results">Unwrapping the results</h3>
<p>Digging into the data behind our 20 personas, there was a clear favorite among ClickUp’s range of features. Tasks!</p>
<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img alt="ClickUp 3.0 Task view Checklist" class="wp-image-116057" decoding="async" height="625" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px" src="https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ClickUp-3.0-Task-view-Checklist.png" srcset="https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ClickUp-3.0-Task-view-Checklist.png 936w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ClickUp-3.0-Task-view-Checklist-300x200.png 300w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ClickUp-3.0-Task-view-Checklist-768x513.png 768w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ClickUp-3.0-Task-view-Checklist-700x467.png 700w" width="936"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Within a ClickUp task, easily create and organize detailed Checklists with groups of to-do items that can even be assigned to other users</figcaption></figure>
</div>
<p>Whether you were updating, creating, editing, or closing them, tasks were hands down the benchmark of your year. And since they’re the foundation of our entire platform, we can’t say we’re too surprised.</p>
<p>Other top feature contenders included Docs, notifications, <a href="https://clickup.com/features/assign-comments">@mentions</a>, <a href="https://clickup.com/features/custom-fields">Custom Fields</a>, <a href="https://clickup.com/features/inbox">Inbox</a>, and of course, ClickUp AI. But what about the people making use of these features?</p>
<p>Let’s take a magnifying glass to your WrapUp and shed some well-deserved light on those who used ClickUp to their greatest advantage. </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-the-master-scribe">The Master Scribe</h4>
<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img alt="Master Scribe Persona Image" class="wp-image-125321" decoding="async" height="735" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px" src="https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Master-Scribe-1400x735.png" srcset="https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Master-Scribe-1400x735.png 1400w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Master-Scribe-300x158.png 300w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Master-Scribe-768x403.png 768w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Master-Scribe-1536x806.png 1536w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Master-Scribe-700x368.png 700w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Master-Scribe.png 1920w" width="1400"/></figure>
</div>
<p>Our most popular persona of the pack this year, a Master Scribe thoroughly understands the importance of a paper trail. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f4c3.png" alt="📃" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>The Master Scribe can be found voluntarily taking meeting notes, revamping your company SOPs, and unabashedly singing the praises of <a href="https://clickup.com/features/slash-commands">Slash Commands</a>. But don’t be fooled—they may have the most stylistic public-facing Docs of the bunch, but the Master Scribe is also sitting on an infinite number of half-finished journal entries and untitled pages that didn’t make the cut. </p>
<p>Thanks for always having the company wiki link on hand, Scribes. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1faf6-1f3fc.png" alt="🫶🏼" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-fomo-friend">FOMO Friend</h4>
<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img alt="FOMO Friend Persona Image" class="wp-image-125293" decoding="async" height="735" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px" src="https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/FOMO-Friend-1400x735.png" srcset="https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/FOMO-Friend-1400x735.png 1400w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/FOMO-Friend-300x158.png 300w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/FOMO-Friend-768x403.png 768w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/FOMO-Friend-1536x806.png 1536w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/FOMO-Friend-700x368.png 700w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/FOMO-Friend.png 1920w" width="1400"/></figure>
</div>
<p>A very close second among our WrapUp personas, the FOMO Friend is the first to not only get your notification but respond and act without skipping a beat. The FOMO Friend always knows the latest update and is likely guilty of checking their ClickUp Inbox outside of work hours (a little more than they’d like to admit). </p>
<p>But it’s a price they’re willing to pay for always having an answer to your manager’s toughest questions on Monday morning. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f61c.png" alt="😜" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>That said, your FOMO Friend is as cool as a cucumber. Always the first to know the latest update, a FOMO Friend is rarely caught off guard.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-perfectionist">Perfectionist</h4>
<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img alt="The Perfectionist Persona Image" class="wp-image-125389" decoding="async" height="735" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px" src="https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/The-Perfectionist-1400x735.png" srcset="https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/The-Perfectionist-1400x735.png 1400w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/The-Perfectionist-300x158.png 300w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/The-Perfectionist-768x403.png 768w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/The-Perfectionist-1536x806.png 1536w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/The-Perfectionist-700x368.png 700w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/The-Perfectionist.png 1920w" width="1400"/></figure>
</div>
<p>Don’t worry—being a perfectionist is a good thing around here. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f49c.png" alt="💜" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>If you identify as a Perfectionist, you’re on your tasks faster than the average user and probably well on your way to that yearly raise. You might’ve had one too many cups of coffee this morning, but not even the smallest action item passes your Workspace unnoticed. </p>
<p>You’re on top of your timelines, have a history in Customer Success roles, and your favorite shape is definitely a gold star. Way to go, Perfectionistas. </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="6-task-master">Task Master</h4>
<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img alt="Task Master Persona Image" class="wp-image-125369" decoding="async" height="735" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px" src="https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Task-Master-1400x735.png" srcset="https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Task-Master-1400x735.png 1400w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Task-Master-300x158.png 300w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Task-Master-768x403.png 768w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Task-Master-1536x806.png 1536w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Task-Master-700x368.png 700w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Task-Master.png 1920w" width="1400"/></figure>
</div>
<p>Ah, the driver of the group—or for my fellow <em>School of Rock</em> fans, your Task Master is your Summer Hathaway. </p>
<p>If you’re a Task Master, you’ve probably created more tasks before breakfast than most do in an entire day. Your personal List serves as a masterclass on organizational excellence and you’re ready to sum up any meeting’s next steps at a moment’s notice. </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="7-gossip-queen">Gossip Queen</h4>
<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img alt="Gossip Queen Persona Image" class="wp-image-125361" decoding="async" height="735" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px" src="https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Gossip-Queen-1400x735.png" srcset="https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Gossip-Queen-1400x735.png 1400w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Gossip-Queen-300x158.png 300w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Gossip-Queen-768x403.png 768w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Gossip-Queen-1536x806.png 1536w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Gossip-Queen-700x368.png 700w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Gossip-Queen.png 1920w" width="1400"/></figure>
</div>
<p>Finally, you and your 12-year-old have something in common. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f64c-1f3fc.png" alt="🙌🏼" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>But there’s nothing wrong with being a people person. In fact, it’ll take you far in business (and in ClickUp). Being a Gossip Queen is also incredibly common as it rounds out our top five most awarded WrapUp personas of 2024!</p>
<p>As the Gossip Queen, you’re the first to light up any Doc or comment with our @mention feature and the most likely to keep the whole team in the loop. That’s a big ask to carry on one person’s shoulders, but you do it with ease—and your stakeholders thank you for it. </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="8-relabeler">Relabeler</h4>
<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img alt="Relabeler Persona Image" class="wp-image-125341" decoding="async" height="735" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px" src="https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Relabeler-1400x735.png" srcset="https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Relabeler-1400x735.png 1400w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Relabeler-300x158.png 300w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Relabeler-768x403.png 768w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Relabeler-1536x806.png 1536w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Relabeler-700x368.png 700w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Relabeler.png 1920w" width="1400"/></figure>
</div>
<p>If you were the Relabeler in your WrapUp, we can guarantee your holiday decorations are neatly stored, color-coded, categorized, and labeled. Everybody’s favorite “Monica,” The Relabeler is equally delighted and stressed at the idea of reorganizing your entire Workspace. Maybe that’s why they take it upon themselves to handle the agency’s Spring cleaning year in and year out. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f338.png" alt="🌸" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Relabelers can create, edit, and rename Custom Fields with an Admid-level of speed and expertise. Not a single billable hour or dime will go unaccounted for on the Relabeler’s watch. So Relabelers, now we’re asking you: <em>What is your favorite monthly task and why is it payroll?</em> </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="9-master-searcher">Master Searcher</h4>
<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img alt="Master Searcher Persona Image" class="wp-image-125357" decoding="async" height="735" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px" src="https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Master-Searcher-1400x735.png" srcset="https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Master-Searcher-1400x735.png 1400w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Master-Searcher-300x158.png 300w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Master-Searcher-768x403.png 768w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Master-Searcher-1536x806.png 1536w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Master-Searcher-700x368.png 700w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Master-Searcher.png 1920w" width="1400"/></figure>
</div>
<p>The Master Searcher is the colleague who has you questioning whether they can read your mind. Ask them for a task, comment, or dataset, they’ll get the link over to you at record speed. How? The power of Universal Search. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f9e0.png" alt="🧠" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Sure, maybe half the time Searchers are just trying to find their favorite LoFi playlists, but they’ve still singlehandedly cut down your team’s lag time by a whopping 60%—probably. </p>

<p>How about a moment of gratitude for all of our Shot Callers out there? The ones with a good head on their shoulders, who never lose their cool, and like Ross Gellar, know how to pivot. </p>
<p>The Shot Caller can prioritize and reprioritize your project tasks with the same level of skill as a mathematician counting cards. Time after time, the Shot Caller saves the day, avoiding missed deadlines and informing everyone of the new plan before you ever see danger coming. </p>

<p>Do you constantly find yourself orchestrating every vacation itinerary and holiday menu? Can you remember everyone’s dietary needs off the top of your head? Or how about this—are you secretly thrilled every time you mark days off of your scheduling book? </p>
<p>Then you, my friend, are a Planner. </p>
<p>Planners have dad-at-the-airport energy in the best way. They’ve mapped out their weeks well in advance and have maximized their time for work and play—but might not always manage to get a full night’s rest.</p>
<p>The Planner is the person who seems to be on the tasks 24/7, updating every little date change and deadline to keep the team on track. Thanks to them, you can actually relax during your holiday time off this year!</p>

<p>You love to set and stick to routines, you always say “Tomorrow’s a new day,” and everything in your home has a designated spot. You’re Captain Clean Slate.</p>
<p>You ensure no task is left untouched at the end of each day and can clear all of your notifications like it’s your job (because it kind of is). And like many other Captain Clean Slates, you’re probably a recovering Type A who’s learning the importance of work-life balance and letting go of what you can’t control. One notification at a time. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1fae1.png" alt="🫡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

</div>
<p>Remember—the Nudger is not “The Nag.” </p>
<p>Every team needs a Nudger, and on more than one occasion, you’ve also probably called them your lifesaver.</p>
<p>Nudgers know the importance of updated task tags and smile at the sight of a well-organized <a href="https://clickup.com/features/calendar-view">Calendar view</a>. They’re “in the know” when it comes to what’s on their plate and what’s on deck, and they rarely have to ask a no-brainer question about their workloads. Maybe that’s why your PM always gifts them a nice bottle of wine every year.</p>

</div>
<p>Voted most likely to “just get it done” in your office superlatives, the Self Starter is the go-getter who updates every task and is happy to do it. Not only can a Self Starter hold a conversation with <em>anyone</em> at the water cooler, but they’re universally described as a pleasure to work with (even Barb in HR thinks so). </p>
<p>Self Starters take it upon themselves to get the ball rolling. No matter where they are in the company org chart, they’re ready to step in and provide an update—because nothing makes them happier than a task marked “Done.”</p>

</div>
<p>It’s no coincidence that Process Prodigies know the quickest routes home and never seem to get stuck waiting for the office coffee machine—these people know how to keep things moving. </p>
<p>Process Prodigies speak Automations like it’s their first language and always have a new concept for scaling workflows that even your manager hadn’t thought of. No one avoids mindless busywork as effectively as the Process Prodigy and yet—at the envy of every other working professional—they always manage to log off before five. </p>

<p>The Tech Wiz is considered a magician with how quickly they get things done. From task summaries to emails, blog drafts, and more, your Tech Wiz is no stranger to ClickUp’s AI tools—just don’t tell them we’re the ones who told you. </p>

<p>Every friend group has a Super Sleuth, and if one doesn’t immediately come to mind—then it’s probably you. If you’re the Super Sleuth, you’re most likely to find the new hire’s LinkedIn, hometown, and star sign before you even share a convo. </p>
<p>No need to update or touch base with your Super Sleuths—they’ve already got their eyes on everything and everyone in the Workspace. Best known for updating task watchers (and adding themselves for good measure), you can rest assured knowing a Super Sleuth is quietly cheering on your progress every step of the way. </p>

<p>Always the first to update task assignees and loop in the team, everyone can count on the Cat Herder to round up the gang. Your easy-going “I got it” attitude in cross-functional projects never ceases to amaze your coworkers. </p>
<p>And let’s face it, if it weren’t for Cat Herder’s keeping us all honest, you probably would’ve missed that Q4 goal. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Raise your hand if 2022 felt like its own decade. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f64b-1f3fc-200d-2640-fe0f.png" alt="🙋🏼‍♀️" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Between the Superbowl half-time show, “the slap heard around the world,” and <em>Don’t Worry Darling</em>, it was an excellent year for meme content. So no matter how high inflation soared, we always had something to laugh about—besides our bank accounts. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f972.png" alt="🥲" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>All this to say, <em>a lot</em> went down this year—enough to keep the conversation fresh at the kids’ table for years to come! But whether you categorized it by the rise and fall of Wordle or Pete Davidson’s dating history, 2022 was one for the history books. </p>
<p>At ClickUp HQ, 2022 will be remembered as the year we turned five years old and made some serious moves in pursuit of our founding mission. It was a year of maturity, growth, and hyper-focus—guided by our core values and never losing sight of the big picture: <em>saving people time so they can focus on the things that matter most.</em> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f49c.png" alt="💜" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>From expanding our global presence to forming new partnerships, feature releases, and industry recognition, 2022 was good for us. Now, we’re entering 2024 feeling grateful for all we’ve accomplished in the last 12 months and ready to play an even greater role in our users’ productivity.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="0-our-year-in-numbers%E2%80%94aka-clickup-wrapped">Our Year in Numbers—AKA, ClickUp Wrapped</h2>
<p>In the whirlwind year that was 2022, we stayed committed to growing 1% every day, both as a team and as a product. And when you add all of those percentages together, the outcome is pretty incredible. </p>
<p>We didn’t just release <a href="https://clickup.com/features/whiteboards">ClickUp Whiteboards</a> and <a href="https://clickup.com/features/docs">Docs 3.0</a>, we never stopped improving them. And based on the <strong>27,935,311 new ClickUp Docs</strong> and <strong>1,117,125 Whiteboards created</strong> in the last 12 months—we can tell you love them as much as we do.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio">
<div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="281" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sf5LUwRwaz8?feature=oembed" title="ClickUp | Whiteboard | Trailer" width="500"></iframe>
</div>
</figure>
<p>What sets these features apart from your average document editor and <a href="/blog?p=35676">digital whiteboard</a> software is the ability to convert text, shapes, notes, and more into action items. Maybe that’s how our users created over <strong>654 <em>million</em> ClickUp tasks</strong> this year. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f913.png" alt="🤓" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>All that efficiency leads to more time spent away from the desk and back where it belongs—with the ones you love, finishing your passion projects, or playing pickleball!</p>
<p>As cool as it is to see these numbers on paper, our favorite part is knowing what our users were able to accomplish <em>because</em> of them. At ClickUp, we live for the thrill of streamlining new processes and powering through our to-do lists, but finding the balance between work and our personal lives makes it all worthwhile! </p>
<p>The real question is: <em>Who are these people crushing their tasks and boosting productivity off the charts?</em> </p>
<p>Nothing inspires us as much as our incredible customers. The wide range of use cases, businesses, and industries ClickUp serves is a testament to our product’s power and potential. Here’s how our customers used ClickUp to take the year by storm:</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-new-year-and-a-ton-of-new-features">New Year and a Ton of New Features</h2>
<p>Since day one, we’ve promised new features each week and we really delivered on that promise. </p>
<p>We put a ton of TLC into our <a href="https://clickup.com/templates">Template Library</a>, creating hundreds of new and <strong>completely free resources</strong> for teams of any size and use case. We also entirely revamped <a href="https://university.clickup.com/">ClickUp University</a> to create a vast course catalog, live training, certifications, and tips to help all of our users master their Platform in record time. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1faf1-1f3fc-200d-1faf2-1f3fe.png" alt="🫱🏼‍🫲🏾" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Motivated by our users, we poured everything we had into our community of users to provide the best service all around. This started from within the platform, adding Portuguese, Spanish, and German localization features to reduce language barriers and connect teams from all over the world using ClickUp. </p>
<p>We then turned to our peers, seeking ways to improve our customer’s experience using ClickUp alongside other tools and devices. This translated into a heap of new <a href="/blog?cat_ID=195" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">partnerships, integrations, and updates</a> including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Massive updates to our scalable, resilient, and innovative <a href="/blog?p=37824">ClickUp infrastructure</a></li>
<li>Hiring seasoned and competitive talent to round out <a href="/blog?p=43203" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">ClickUp’s leadership team</a></li>

<p>You know you’re doing something right when other people start to notice, and 2022 was a major year for us regarding awards and recognition. </p>
<p>One of our greatest achievements of the year, we were proud to earn our place on the <a href="/blog?p=40325">Forbes Cloud 100</a> list, the definitive ranking of the top private cloud companies in the world for 2022.  </p>
<p>ClickUp also ranked highly among <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/linkedin-top-startups-2022-50-us-companies-rise-linkedin-news/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">LinkedIn’s Top StartUps</a> for the second year in a row, found a home among the best of <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/technology-media-and-telecommunications/articles/fast500-winners.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Deloitte’s Technology Fast 500</a>, was recognized on <a href="https://qz.com/list/best-companies-to-work-from-home-2022/large" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Quartz’s list of Best Places to Work</a> for Remote Teams, <em>and more.</em></p>
<p>All while climbing to the number one spot on G2 for <a href="https://www.g2.com/reports/momentum-grid-report-for-strategy-and-innovation-roadmapping-tools-winter-2024.embed?featured=clickup&amp;secure%5Bgated_consumer%5D=f84d2ebd-a09d-45cb-9277-d49cc4fee49a&amp;secure%5Btoken%5D=171f53e663b54099630f3900b240cdf9296766ceb7a5ec1280683e7ab30cc682&amp;utm_campaign=gate-1864337">Strategy and Innovation Roadmapping</a> (Software teams), <a href="https://www.g2.com/reports/momentum-grid-report-for-marketing-calendar-winter-2024.embed?featured=clickup&amp;secure%5Bgated_consumer%5D=50b3389c-157d-4140-a2ed-1692cf8ada40&amp;secure%5Btoken%5D=c9d80e9a88f8269f8e832e9e95a85faa21dd7f6f4839459c275601311c677a22&amp;utm_campaign=gate-1865314" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Marketing Calendar</a> (marketing), and <a href="https://www.g2.com/reports/momentum-grid-report-for-project-and-portfolio-management-winter-2024.embed?featured=clickup&amp;secure%5Bgated_consumer%5D=fb3ee1b7-972f-4577-8d36-4da588409906&amp;secure%5Btoken%5D=5495c2f43b4fad9f475cea3fec57611aecfe6a2e640b513d454b7badbdae43b8&amp;utm_campaign=gate-1864372" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Project and Portfolio Management</a> (PMO). These recognitions mean the world to us because they’re entirely based on <strong><em>your</em></strong> ratings!</p>
<p>We stayed dedicated to the <a href="https://clickup.com/about">seven core values</a> that guide our work at ClickUp every day—especially, paying it forward with random acts of kindness. With this in mind, ClickUp has contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations, food, and time to those in need of a helping hand. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-kicking-off-2024-productive-af">Kicking Off 2024 Productive AF</h2>
<p>Beyond the Platform, our content is another way we give back to our readers and users—because without you, none of this would be possible! </p>
<p>Plus, we don’t gatekeep! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>There is a wealth of knowledge to tap into with our ever-growing team of dedicated ClickUppers, and our <a href="https://clickup.com/blog/">blog</a> and newsletter are two of our favorite ways to share it with you all. P.S., <em>have you <a href="https://clickup.com/newsletter">subscribed to WriteClick</a> yet?! </em></p>
<p>The new year is the time to rethink your short and long-term goals, create personal action plans, and tap into your productivity. It’s also the perfect time to let go of the things that once held you back in order to push forward—and ClickUp has every resource needed to guide you on that front. </p>
<p>Companies are actively seeking new <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/the-social-economy" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">technology to bring teams together</a>, regardless of whether they work in person, from home, or somewhere in the middle. This puts ClickUp in a unique spot because we’re not <em>just</em> in the business of project management, work management, or collaboration—we’re entirely centered around productivity.</p>
<p>“Work” looks completely different now than it did two years ago, and the only thing we can reliably predict going forward is <a href="https://asana.com/resources/anatomy-of-work#form" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">the ability to pivot at any time</a>. </p>
<p>We’ve taken this to heart and can’t wait to share what ClickUp has in store for 2024, starting with our third annual <a href="https://clickup.com/events/levelup">productivity conference, LevelUp</a>, happening in February. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f64c-1f3fc.png" alt="🙌🏼" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-a-heartfelt-thank-you">A Heartfelt Thank You</h2>
<p>Before we collectively toast our Negroni Sbagliatos in celebration of another productive year at ClickUp, we want to acknowledge that 2022 was an incredible challenge for so many people, on every level. </p>
<p>As fun as it is to look back on all of the good things that happened as a whole, 2022 was not without its trials and tribulations, many of which continue to plague the world even as we enter 2024. </p>
<p>In the spirit of the new year, new beginnings, and new opportunities, these hurdles have only reinforced the fact that we are a community. And a strong one, at that! </p>
<p>We support each other, push each other, and give back to each other. As an industry, we’ve all felt the wave of change, and it may not be over yet, but we will ride the tide together! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f30a.png" alt="🌊" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Change is the only constant, and at ClickUp, we choose to face it head-on and embrace it each and every day. </p>
<p>We are entering the new year feeling excited about the future of our product, energized by its momentum, and committed to delivering the best service to our community of productivity junkies. </p>
<p>Love you, nerds. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f49c.png" alt="💜" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>Job seekers <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/389807/top-things-employees-next-job.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">say</a> they&#8217;re eager to find new roles in which they can do their best work. This is a complex puzzle for business leaders to solve, but at least one thing is clear: providing teams with the right digital tools has never been more important.</p>



<p>Research <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/new-research-why-employee-wellbeing-is-the-next-frontier-of-work-technology/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">shows</a> that employees who are satisfied with their work technology are 30% less likely to feel burned out and 29% more likely to say they&#8217;re happy on the job. They are also 23% more likely to recommend their employer as a great place to work.</p>



<p>We understand that your employees are your most important asset (we feel the same!) and it&#8217;s important for them to like the tools they use. We want the time that they spend in <a href="https://clickup.com/">ClickUp</a> to be enjoyable and that&#8217;s why we&#8217;re committed to improving the stability and usability of our platform. It&#8217;s important to us that we are offering you the best and most reliable possible product experience.</p>



<p>Over the past several months, we have made incredible progress toward making ClickUp even more reliable and easier to use. Today, I am delighted to share some of the most transformational milestones that we&#8217;ve achieved.</p>


<div class="wp-block-ub-table-of-contents-block ub_table-of-contents" id="ub_table-of-contents-97958d05-575f-4ed4-83f5-a7fdbf33ff82" data-linktodivider="false" data-showtext="show" data-hidetext="hide" data-scrolltype="auto" data-initiallyhideonmobile="false"

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="0-laying-a-strong-foundation">Laying a Strong Foundation</h2>



<p>Before we dive into the technology improvements, I think it&#8217;s important to acknowledge some of the changes we&#8217;ve made at an organizational level. It has been a massive priority for us to get more talent in the doors at ClickUp—especially in roles that directly impact your experience.</p>



<p>We have been actively investing in our engineering and support staff and over the last year, we hired more than 150 engineers to help support our development efforts. As part of this effort, we brought in two seasoned VPs of Engineering—<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ggeyfman/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gennadiy Geyfman</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chirag-chheda/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chirag Chheda</a>—both of whom bring incredible experience building platforms at massive scale at companies like Lyft, Facebook, Amazon, Salesforce, and Microsoft. Gennadiy is focused on stabilizing our platform as we grow, while Chirag is scaling ClickUp&#8217;s product engineering organization.</p>



<p>We also hired a Global VP of Customer Success, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joelhuntington/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Joel Huntington</a>, who joins us from Qualtrics to oversee the global customer service team. This team is dedicated to helping customers drive greater productivity using ClickUp and serve as powerful advocates by educating them on best practices and ensuring they feel fully supported.&nbsp;Joel joins ClickUp after five years at Qualtrics.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-rebuilding-and-reinforcing">Rebuilding and Reinforcing</h2>



<p>While we place an immense amount of value in the people of ClickUp that are moving our mission forward, I know you all came to this blog for an update on the ClickUp platform and we have a lot of exciting updates to share. Here&#8217;s an overview of what we&#8217;ve accomplished over the last few months alone:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Achieved and Exceeded Uptime Goals: </strong>We are trending toward exceeding 99.9% uptime every month in most of our products and services, ensuring consistency in accessing and refreshing tasks, attachments, and data within ClickUp. This means that you can expect a more reliable, smoother, and consistent experience.</li><li><strong>Lock Solid Security:</strong> We <a href="https://clickup.com/blog/iso-certifications/">completed the formal certification</a> of ISO 27001:2013, ISO 27017:2015, and ISO 27018:2019. These certifications prove ClickUp&#8217;s commitment to security, privacy, quality, and trust for our customers. We&#8217;re proud of these certifications because we know how important it is for your work to be secure. It also serves as evidence that we are well ahead of the competition and other platforms in this space when it comes to security.</li><li><strong>Platform Sharding</strong>: We are continuing an ongoing effort to re-architect our platform around smaller, more geographically dispersed databases &#8211; a process known as sharding. By doing so, we will be able to guarantee high performance and reliability as we continue to scale.</li><li><strong>Improved Load Times: </strong>Last quarter we made some significant improvements as it relates to the load times of views including our Home, Workload view, <a href="https://clickup.com/features/kanban-board">Board view</a>, and notifications page. With improved page load times, you&#8217;ll be able to access work more quickly and reliably.</li><li><strong>New and Improved Search</strong>: Following our <a href="https://clickup.com/blog/slapdash-acquisition/">Slapdash acquisition</a>, we revamped our search capabilities. Today, you&#8217;ll see much more relevant results in a fraction of the time. On average, our new search is 2x faster than the previous version, in other words, you spend less time hunting and more time doing!</li><li><strong>Revamping the Command Center: </strong>We rebuilt the Command Center and combined it with Search to create a single sleek interface for searching and running commands. You can now easily create a new task, doc, or reminder in seconds. Our goal is for ClickUp to have the world&#8217;s best integrated-search experience.</li><li><strong>Faster Notifications: </strong>We are making notifications more performant by cleaning up our massive database. In doing so, we will be better equipped to scale the platform long-term. Immediately you will receive notifications 30% faster. We’re also redefining how we retrieve notifications in our database, to help you better stay on top of your work.</li><li><strong>Mobile App Revamp</strong>: Accessing work on the go is a critical feature for today&#8217;s hybrid and <a href="https://clickup.com/teams/remote-work">remote teams</a>. With that in mind, we increased the speed at which you can access and interact with the <a href="https://clickup.com/download">ClickUp mobile app</a> 2,000x both online and offline. We are continuing to enhance the offline performance of the app for enhanced reliability anywhere you need to use it.</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-listening-and-acting">Listening and Acting</h2>



<p>As I&#8217;ve mentioned before, we want to reassure you that we are listening and working hard on your requests. We&#8217;ve seen your feedback on features like <a href="https://clickup.com/features/automations">Automations</a>, <a href="https://clickup.com/features/dashboards">Dashboards</a>, and platform refresh issues and can assure you that they are on the <a href="https://dev-doc.clickup.com/p/ad-3021/click-up-roadmap/ad-3021/click-up-roadmap">product roadmap</a> and in the process of coming to life<strong>.</strong></p>



<p>We have already re-architected our Dashboards so that the widgets operate more smoothly and are almost done with revamping our WebSockets so that refresh issues will be obsolete. We hope that you&#8217;ve already been able to experience the benefits of this work and we&#8217;re confident that you&#8217;ll continue to see ongoing improvements.</p>



<p>We are so proud of the work that has been done, but it&#8217;s important to acknowledge that these projects take time to complete. We are committed to making substantial, high-quality improvements that will stand the test of time and are doing so quickly and efficiently.</p>



<p>We can&#8217;t wait to fully unveil the culmination of these efforts at our LevelUp event in early 2023! Registration for our 2023 event is <a href="https://clickup.com/events/levelup">open now</a> and we look forward to connecting with you about the future of our product.</p>

<p>As you already know, protecting the security and privacy of our customers and their data is our top priority at <a href="https://clickup.com/">ClickUp</a>.</p>



<p>Today, we are thrilled to announce another step forward in demonstrating our commitment to ensuring customer trust! ClickUp has achieved ISO 27001, ISO 27017, and ISO27018 certifications. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f3c6.png" alt="🏆" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </p>



<p>This is huge! These certifications prove ClickUp&#8217;s abilities and preparedness to support customers of all sizes from around the globe.</p>



<p>So, what does this mean for you? It means that you can have even more confidence that ClickUp is protecting the privacy of you and your customers while making meeting security compliance and regulatory requirements a piece of cake. ﻿<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f370.png" alt="🍰" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />﻿</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="0-what-is-iso">What is ISO?</h2>



<p>The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is an independent, non-governmental, international body that develops standards to ensure the quality, safety, and efficiency of products, services, and systems.</p>



<p>ISO 27001:2013 is considered one of the highest standards of security for customer data in software. Achieving certification requires a rigorous third-party audit. </p>



<p>They don&#8217;t hand these out to just anyone! This accomplishment represents a proactive and relentless effort to ensure our systems, servers, and products are&nbsp;industry-leading in security&nbsp;and compliance.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-how-did-clickup-achieve-certification">How Did ClickUp Achieve Certification?</h2>



<p>Organizations and end-users need to know that their data can be trusted in the hands of a SaaS provider. This is why we partnered closely with <a href="https://www.schellman.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Schellman Company LLC</a>, a leading provider of attestation and compliance services, to independently audit and verify our organizational and technology controls. Schellman’s audit confirms ClickUp&#8217;s world-class security and our commitment to continuous improvement.</p>



<p>If you nerd out on security like us, here are some extra details! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f913.png" alt="🤓" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </p>



<p>The ISO examination was conducted via a thorough audit of ClickUp’s servers, systems, processes, procedures, and the ClickUp solution. This examination covered ISO&#8217;s <a href="https://clickup.com/templates/project-plan/iso-27001-implementation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ISO 27001 standards</a>:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The information security management system is part of and integrated with the organization’s processes and overall management structure;</li>



<li>Information security is considered in the design of processes, information systems, and controls; and</li>



<li>The information security management system implementation will be scaled in accordance with the needs of the organization</li>
</ul>



<p>ClickUp’s successful ISO audit was focused on customer data as it relates to security. The results reveal that ClickUp’s information and systems are thoroughly protected against unauthorized access, disclosure of information, and damage to systems. </p>



<p>In other words, you&#8217;re in good hands!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-our-continual-commitment-to-your-security-">Our Continual Commitment to Your Security <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f91d.png" alt="🤝" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></h2>



<p>We know how important the security of your data is to you and your business. When you use ClickUp, you are putting your trust in us to protect that data at every level. </p>



<p>This is why we hold our commitment to security and privacy as our highest priority. Beyond investing in this type of thorough security review, we continue to deliver on our commitment to earning customer trust every day by:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Releasing a new and improved version of ClickUp&nbsp;<a href="https://help.clickup.com/hc/en-us/categories/5414371924503-ClickUpdates-Release-Notes-">every week</a></li>

<li>Achieving (and maintaining) compliance with the most&nbsp;<a href="https://clickup.com/security">rigorous security protocols and certifications</a></li>
</ul>



<p>Our successful ISO 27001 certification is only the latest milestone in delivering on our commitment. Because at the end of the day, we built ClickUp to empower everyone to get more done— without ever having to worry about data or privacy being compromised. ﻿<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f512.png" alt="🔒" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />﻿</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The<strong> </strong>20th of June kicked off <strong>World Productivity Week</strong>—a time to stop and celebrate productivity wins and the advancements we&#8217;ve made over the years as well as <strong>set new commitments for how we can be more productive in the years to come</strong>. </p>



<p>Since starting ClickUp back in 2017, our vision to <strong>deliver an all-in-one productivity platform</strong> that <strong>saves people time</strong> and <strong>makes people more productive</strong> remains unchanged. </p>



<p>However, what <em>has</em> changed is our world and the way we work together. </p>



<p>Many of us have moved from working exclusively in-office to working in a remote or hybrid environment, transitioning from desk-side chats to digital conversations to stay in sync. Many of us were already working remotely (ClickUp has always been ~50% remote) but are now supporting a wider range of team members, customers, and partners around the world. Either way, we&#8217;re all endlessly searching for better solutions and tools to support inefficiencies created in this new way of working. </p>



<p>One thing that remains constant in both the world and our vision is the value placed on <strong>being&nbsp;<em>productiv</em>e at work.</strong> </p>



<p>But how can we maintain and increase productivity while wading through the endless silos created by the proliferation of today&#8217;s modern apps? How can we be productive if we&#8217;re wasting hours each day searching for information, switching context, and getting distracted by endless pings?&nbsp;How do <a href="https://clickup.com/blog/cross-functional-teams/">cross-functional teams</a> align and handoff more succinctly? How do we all maintain balance and productivity without burning out?</p>



<p>At ClickUp, we believe that to be genuinely productive in this new era; all <strong>work should be connected and centralized in one (peaceful) place</strong>. Managing work across different apps should not cause confusion. No one should struggle to find the information they need to do their jobs. And they shouldn&#8217;t be distracted by the noise that takes their focus away from what&#8217;s really important. </p>



<p>So, it&#8217;s only fitting that on World Productivity Day, we <strong>share with you the most exciting news in our history</strong> about how we plan to further help you reach new productivity heights.</p>



<p><strong>Today, I&#8217;m introducing ClickUp 3.0 (coming this year), our next-generation productivity platform </strong>built to support the new era of teamwork. 3.0 will be the connective tissue that brings teams, knowledge, and work together more closely and efficiently than ever before. </p>



<div class="videoWrapper" style="margin: 50px 0 30px;"><iframe loading="lazy" style="border-radius: 5px; border: 1px solid #ccc;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EGB_O5FY-8U" width="100%" height="400" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></div>



<p><strong>Highlights:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Cutting-edge architecture&nbsp;</strong>that is highly performant and scalable so that users have trust that the ClickUp platform will consistently help them deliver results.</li><li><strong>Connecting people</strong>&nbsp;around shared projects and goals, so they feel like they&#8217;re working closely together, even when they&#8217;re far apart.</li><li><strong>Bringing work together&nbsp;</strong>not only from within ClickUp but from other applications too, so users aren&#8217;t constantly having to jump from app to app, frustrated by all the time they&#8217;re wasting.</li><li><strong>Unleashing knowledge</strong> often trapped in siloed systems by making it easy to find in one place, so everyone has the information they need to get their work done and make smarter decisions.</li><li><strong>Personalizing context</strong>&nbsp;based on users&#8217; prioritized projects, relationships, and interests, so they can focus on the work that matters most without unnecessary distractions.</li></ul>



<p><strong>ClickUp 3.0 will transform productivity more than the first iteration of ClickUp did 5 years ago.</strong></p>



<p>We&#8217;re working tirelessly to create this platform that will not only be delightful to use but will also give teams more of the one thing they can never get back &#8211; time!</p>



<p>Thanks for joining us on this journey of making the world more productive, together. </p>

<p>Everyone has heard the saying that knowledge is power. But that&#8217;s only true if you can find it and use it to your advantage. Otherwise, it&#8217;s pretty much useless! </p>



<p>If you&#8217;ve ever tried to tap into the collective knowledge within your company, you know how hard it is. It&#8217;s trapped in a variety of apps, siloed across teams, and buried deep in the brains of tenured colleagues. </p>



<p>But here&#8217;s the scary part. Companies are using more work apps today than ever before. This started with good intentions—a specialized app for every team—but juggling all those apps quickly spiraled into a web of chaos and inefficiency. As teams piled on tools, the knowledge accessibility problem got worse. </p>



<p>The very first version of ClickUp was created out of frustrations from using more than a dozen tools to get our work done &#8211; when in reality they were actually slowing us down. The details we needed kept getting lost or misplaced.</p>



<p>From the time ClickUp was born to 2020, the average number of apps used by companies increased by a factor of five according to <a href="http://pages.bettercloud.com/rs/719-KZY-706/images/2020_StateofSaaSOpsReport.pdf?mkt_tok=NzE5LUtaWS03MDYAAAF8LQdmoC7u54xbqxNwp0au4Zk7SiYaaqq2vupXFxCvaP5vY8gSQtlGFsUsRI8oj5Fl2m5PwIZUUAlzVZL_-hUEQ2RdNqgEzDAmZA5bZtowS_v-zMs" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">BetterCloud</a>!</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1170" height="541" src="https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/image-12.png" alt="BetterCloud SaaS apps used by organizations" class="wp-image-35996" srcset="https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/image-12.png 1170w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/image-12-300x139.png 300w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/image-12-768x355.png 768w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/image-12-700x324.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" /></figure></div>



<p>Employees have just about had it. Every single day, employees spend about an hour simply searching for the information they need to do their jobs, and <a href="https://assets.qatalog.com/language.work/qatalog-2021-workgeist-report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">7 out of 10 wish there could be more efficient ways of using company apps do to their work</a>. </p>



<p>Especially in the age of The Great Resignation, making it easier for employees to access and act upon company knowledge represents an enormous opportunity to provide better work experiences, leading to greater employee satisfaction and retention. And on top of that, they&#8217;ll get back the most precious commodity there is&#8230;time.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Accelerating Our Mission with a Strategic Acquisition</strong></h2>



<p>At ClickUp, our core mission is to <strong>make the world more productive by saving people time</strong>. When we learned how much time people wasted as they struggled to access the knowledge they needed to do their jobs, we felt the need to act. So we did something incredible. </p>



<p>We acquired <a href="https://slapdash.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Slapdash</a>! Slapdash makes it incredibly easy for people to quickly tap into their company&#8217;s collective knowledge that, until now, was nearly impossible to find. </p>



<p>Slapdash, the leader in unified search, empowers anyone to find what they need across their favorite SaaS solutions from one central location. Slapdash is also lightning fast, with relevant search results appearing instantly! It&#8217;s no easy feat from an engineering perspective, which is why we&#8217;re so excited about the technology and the promise it holds.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>There&#8217;s More to the Story</strong></h2>



<p>Making it easy for people to access critical information and assets in one place is a game-changer. What&#8217;s even better is that Slapdash, with its unique command bar, also allows people to take action on that information: share it, comment on it, edit it, and more. Edit a record in Salesforce, create a new task in ClickUp, or join a meeting in Zoom with one quick tap of the keyboard. There are more than 40 business apps to connect with today, and more on the horizon. </p>



<p>In addition to Slapdash&#8217;s proprietary technology, their mission to unify work and save people time aligns perfectly with ours. By joining forces, we can achieve this shared mission better and faster. </p>



<p>We are beyond excited to welcome Slapdash founders &#8211; Ivan Kanevski and Dmitry Koterov &#8211; and the whole Slapdash team to the ClickUp family, and we’re already hard at work integrating the Slapdash technology natively into our all-in-one productivity platform.</p>



<p>Stay tuned! We&#8217;re excited to share more details in the near future about how this will transform workplace productivity. </p>

<p>When the pandemic first hit and employees shifted to remote work, businesses around the world scrambled to adapt to what appears to be the new normal.</p>



<p>While many employees have enjoyed the flexibility that remote work provides, it hasn&#8217;t come without challenges. With the absence of desk-side chats, team lunches, and in-person meetings, many workers have struggled with loneliness—<a href="https://buffer.com/state-of-remote-work/2022" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">with more than half feeling less connected to their co-workers since shifting to remote work</a>. </p>



<p>To reconnect these workers, businesses turned to technology to help them work together more efficiently, regardless of their location. In fact, since 2019 there has been a <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-08-23-gartner-survey-reveals-44-percent-rise-in-workers-use-of-collaboration-tools-since-2019" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">44% rise in the use of collaboration tools</a>. And of course, that increase was fueled by a host of new apps as vendors vied to meet the demands of the new hybrid worker. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Rise of the Virtual Whiteboard</h2>



<p>Unable to huddle around a physical whiteboard together wielding a colorful set of EXPO dry erase markers, <a href="https://clickup.com/blog/best-whiteboard-software/">teams turned to virtual whiteboards</a>, which have become incredibly popular during the pandemic. Virtual whiteboards joined a long list of point solutions that companies invested in to boost the productivity of their distributed workforce. These include tools for brainstorming, content creation, work automation, communication, project management, and everything in between. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, these tools rarely work well together. Instead of bringing employees and teams closer together, many businesses made the problem worse by spreading work across an ever-expanding set of tools. </p>



<p>As a result, teams would brainstorm, <a href="https://clickup.com/blog/idea-management-software/">share ideas and map out projects</a>—but often, these ideas and plans never made it past the virtual whiteboard. The reason these ideas aren&#8217;t typically executed is that it would require a mess of other tools that are not only disconnected from the virtual whiteboard, but also from one another. It&#8217;s no wonder that workers are frustrated. </p>

<p>Built natively into ClickUp&#8217;s productivity platform, ClickUp Whiteboards are the only virtual white-boarding tool on the market that can seamlessly bridge the gap between <a href="https://clickup.com/blog/ideation-techniques/">ideation and execution</a> for today&#8217;s distributed workforce. Working alongside our core set of apps—including tasks, Docs, Goals, Dashboards, and more—ClickUp provides a single place for distributed teams to come up with great ideas together <strong>AND </strong>work collaboratively to bring those ideas to life. </p>



<p>Sound good to you? If so, you&#8217;re not the only one. In fact, 9 out of 10 workers* today say they would prefer to be able to manage all their work in one place, rather than using different tools for different tasks. </p>
