										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’re part of a software team, you know how tough it can be to manage multiple apps and workflows. Juggling different tools leads to confusion, wasted time, missed deadlines, and headaches galore.</p>
<p>Fortunately, ClickUp Forms can make things easier. With Forms, you can easily collect data from your team, clients, or customers. And the best part? It’s all integrated into the rest of the ClickUp platform, which makes it easier to stay on top of your work, all in one place.</p>
<p>In this blog, we’re going to show you exactly how ClickUp Forms can solve some of the most common pain points that software teams face.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="0-1-forms-for-detailed-bug-reporting">1. Forms for Detailed Bug Reporting</h2>
<p>Using ClickUp Forms helps <a href="/blog?p=120501">streamline the process</a> of reporting bugs by preventing duplicate entries and ensuring all critical information is collected. Here are some steps to get started.</p>
<ol>
<li>Create the list that you want <a href="/blog?p=58545">bug reports</a> to flow into, then add a new view and select Form</li>
<li>Add the necessary fields for collecting bug report information. Some common fields to include are:
<ul>
<li><strong>Description of the bug</strong></li>
<li><strong>Steps to reproduce the bug</strong></li>
<li><strong>Device and operating system information</strong></li>
<li><strong>Browser information</strong></li>
<li><strong>Error messages (if applicable)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Severity of the bug</strong></li>
<li><strong>Priority level</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Customize the form to match your team’s brand. You may also want to include instructions or guidelines for filling out the form</li>
<li>Test the form yourself to ensure that it works properly</li>
<li>Launch it to users by sharing the link to the ClickUp Form on your website, within your software, or through other communication channels</li>
<li>As responses come in, review and assign them to the appropriate team members for resolution. <em>Hint: You can also use Automations to do this automatically</em> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-2-forms-for-your-feature-requests">2. Forms for Your Feature Requests</h2>
<p>Having a formal feature request process in place helps prioritize which features or enhancements to work on next. By using ClickUp Forms for this process, you can ensure that everyone’s requests are heard and that the team can focus on building the most impactful features for your product.</p>
<p>Here are some fields you might want to include for a user-facing form:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Feature description</strong>: A brief overview of what feature the user wants to add and what it aims to accomplish</li>
<li><strong>Use case</strong>: A description of how the feature will be used</li>
<li><strong>Contact information</strong>: The name and contact info of the person or account making the request</li>
</ul>
<p>You might also consider making an internal-only form for members of your team to submit their ideas. In which case, additional fields may help you scope out the request further:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Priority level</strong></li>
<li><strong>Technical specifications</strong></li>
<li><strong>Estimated time and resources</strong></li>
<li><strong>Dependencies</strong></li>
<li><strong>Stakeholder and/or team name</strong></li>
<li><strong>Acceptance criteria</strong></li>

</div>
<p class="has-text-color has-background" style="color:#00000099;background-color:#7bdbb570;font-size:15px"><strong><sup>PRO TIP</sup></strong><br />
Use Conditional Logic to combine your Bug Reporting and Feature Request Forms! This feature allows you to create a customized form experience based on how users respond to specific questions. For example, your software team could have one form that asks if the user is reporting a bug or submitting a feature request. With Conditional Logic, if the user selects “Reporting a Bug,” then the form would show questions related to that process only. If they answer “Submitting a Feature Request,” then the form would only show questions related to <em>that</em> process.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-3-forms-for-your-code-reviews">3. Forms for Your Code Reviews</h2>
<p>Keep all <a href="/blog?p=5096">collaboration</a> and <a href="/blog?p=48192">communication</a> between engineering and development team members in one place by conducting code reviews in ClickUp Forms. Here are some fields you might want to include to help you facilitate a more organized and efficient review process:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Code author</strong></li>
<li><strong>Code reviewer</strong></li>
<li><strong>Date review was conducted</strong></li>
<li><strong>Code repository</strong> (name or URL)</li>
<li><strong>Functionality</strong>: A description of the code’s intended functionality</li>
<li><strong>Coding standards</strong>: A list of <a href="/blog?p=60775">coding standards or best practices</a> that the code is being evaluated against (e.g. readability, maintainability, adherence to style guide, etc.)</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong>: A section to assess the code for security vulnerabilities and compliance with security standards</li>
<li><strong>Testing</strong>: A section to assess the code for testability and to evaluate the completeness and adequacy of the tests written</li>
<li><strong>Comments</strong></li>
<li><strong>Approval</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Bonus: <a href="/blog?p=73313">Google Forms Vs. Microsoft Forms</a>! </em></strong></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-consider-clickup-forms-for-your-software-team">Consider ClickUp Forms for Your Software Team</h2>
<p>There you have it! ClickUp Forms is the ultimate solution for software, engineering, and development teams looking to streamline their intake processes. With customized Forms that <a href="/blog?p=53311">automate workflows</a> and improve communication, you’ll never look back.</p>

<p>Have you ever wished you could see your project&#8217;s progress with just a glance? Well, now you can with Dashboard views! It&#8217;s like having superpowers for your work.</p>



<p>With Dashboards as a view, you can take what you&#8217;re already working on and turn it into charts and graphs in just a few clicks—click add view, Dashboard view, and choose a Dashboard template. The view automatically pulls data from the tasks/fields you&#8217;re working in to create a Dashboard to visualize your work.</p>

<p>Clips are designed to make your communication clearer, faster, and more efficient.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="0-instantly-share-screen-recordings-with-clips">Instantly Share Screen Recordings With Clips</h2>



<p>Ever felt lost in comment threads? We all have because everyone has so much to say! </p>



<p>With Clips, those days are over. Now, you can instantly create and share videos to get your point across without any confusion. It&#8217;s as simple as hitting record, sharing your screen, and sending ideas to your team faster than you can type a response.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1400" height="849" src="https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Instantly-share-clips-within-ClickUp-example-1400x849.png" alt="Instantly share clips within ClickUp example" class="wp-image-152343" srcset="https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Instantly-share-clips-within-ClickUp-example-1400x849.png 1400w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Instantly-share-clips-within-ClickUp-example-300x182.png 300w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Instantly-share-clips-within-ClickUp-example-768x466.png 768w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Instantly-share-clips-within-ClickUp-example-1536x931.png 1536w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Instantly-share-clips-within-ClickUp-example-700x424.png 700w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Instantly-share-clips-within-ClickUp-example.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px" /></figure>



<p>Clips are totally different than other screen recording tools because they&#8217;re embedded where you already work. No need to switch between apps or upload files—create a Clip everywhere you communicate. </p>



<p>Whether you&#8217;re giving feedback on a design or explaining a complex concept, Clips help you get your point across as quickly and clearly as possible.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-add-much-needed-context-when-collaborating">Add Much-needed Context When Collaborating</h2>



<p>Companies are becoming more remote and distributed, which means it&#8217;s harder than ever to stay on the same page with your team. Communication is often easier and better as a conversation, but finding time to meet is challenging, and creates unnecessary delays.</p>



<p>Clips brings people back together by making it easy to understand the thought process of anyone you work with. Need to walk someone through a spreadsheet or show a <a href="/blog?p=58545">bug on a website</a>? Just record your entire screen, tab, or app, narrate your thoughts, and share the Clip. </p>



<p>Your team sees exactly what you&#8217;re seeing, eliminating guesswork and speeding up decision-making.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1400" height="849" src="https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ClickUp-Clips-share-screen-example-1400x849.png" alt="ClickUp Clips share screen example" class="wp-image-152347" srcset="https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ClickUp-Clips-share-screen-example-1400x849.png 1400w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ClickUp-Clips-share-screen-example-300x182.png 300w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ClickUp-Clips-share-screen-example-768x466.png 768w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ClickUp-Clips-share-screen-example-1536x931.png 1536w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ClickUp-Clips-share-screen-example-700x424.png 700w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ClickUp-Clips-share-screen-example.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px" /></figure>



<p>Sharing Clips is incredibly flexible too. Embed a Clip directly in ClickUp, send a public link to anyone outside your Workspace, or download the video file for any other purpose. Anyone who watches your Clip can add a comment right on the video to start a conversation about specific ideas that were shared.</p>



<p>Every Clip comment shows the timestamp in the video where it was created, and exactly where it was pinned on the screen. This visual anchoring helps teams get clarity on specific ideas without creating endless comment threads that nobody ends up reading.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1400" height="841" src="https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ClickUp-Clips-Comments-Breakdown-Example-1400x841.png" alt="ClickUp Clips Comments Breakdown Example" class="wp-image-152351" srcset="https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ClickUp-Clips-Comments-Breakdown-Example-1400x841.png 1400w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ClickUp-Clips-Comments-Breakdown-Example-300x180.png 300w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ClickUp-Clips-Comments-Breakdown-Example-768x461.png 768w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ClickUp-Clips-Comments-Breakdown-Example-1536x922.png 1536w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ClickUp-Clips-Comments-Breakdown-Example-700x420.png 700w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ClickUp-Clips-Comments-Breakdown-Example.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-take-action-on-ideas-shared">Take Action on Ideas Shared</h2>



<p>Clips aren’t just about sharing information—they’re about driving action. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;ve made it so easy to turn any Clip into action within ClickUp. Embed the Clip into a task description, assign team members, and move it to a List where you already work. </p>



<p>This way, the ideas and insights shared in your Clips become actionable, making it easier to propel your projects forward.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1400" height="849" src="https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ClickUp-Clips-Task-Description-Example-1400x849.png" alt="ClickUp Clips Task Description Example" class="wp-image-152355" srcset="https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ClickUp-Clips-Task-Description-Example-1400x849.png 1400w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ClickUp-Clips-Task-Description-Example-300x182.png 300w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ClickUp-Clips-Task-Description-Example-768x466.png 768w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ClickUp-Clips-Task-Description-Example-1536x931.png 1536w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ClickUp-Clips-Task-Description-Example-700x424.png 700w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ClickUp-Clips-Task-Description-Example.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-get-instant-insights-with-ai">Get Instant Insights With AI</h2>



<p>We&#8217;re also excited to expand the powers of <a href="https://clickup.com/ai" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ClickUp Brain</a>, our very own native AI tool. Now, ClickUp Brain uses AI to automatically transcribe every Clip you create. </p>



<p>This means you can quickly scan the highlights of a Clip, jump to specific parts of the video with timestamps, and even copy text snippets to use elsewhere. It&#8217;s like having a smart assistant that automatically makes every video more useful.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1400" height="849" src="https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ClickUp-Clips-AI-Transcription-feature-example-1400x849.png" alt="ClickUp Clips AI Transcription feature example" class="wp-image-152359" srcset="https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ClickUp-Clips-AI-Transcription-feature-example-1400x849.png 1400w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ClickUp-Clips-AI-Transcription-feature-example-300x182.png 300w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ClickUp-Clips-AI-Transcription-feature-example-768x466.png 768w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ClickUp-Clips-AI-Transcription-feature-example-1536x931.png 1536w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ClickUp-Clips-AI-Transcription-feature-example-700x424.png 700w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ClickUp-Clips-AI-Transcription-feature-example.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px" /></figure>



<p>ClickUp Brain takes knowledge management to a whole new level because it can now access every Clip transcript. This means anyone in your workspace can use <strong>Ask AI</strong> for any question they want, and ClickUp Brain combs through every Clip transcript they&#8217;ve created to find answers buried in videos. </p>



<p>This powerful tool unlocks the knowledge saved in Clips, making it instantly available at any time in the future.</p>



<p>For example, you could ask something as simple as &#8220;<em>Where are the Clips related to the upcoming marketing project?</em>&#8221; and ClickUp Brain will retrieve and link to all the Clips related to the initiative. </p>



<p>You could drill down even further, and ask &#8220;<em>What products are we planning to launch in the next quarter?</em>&#8221; and Clips will not only provide a summary of the answer, but it will include the Clips and Docs that were referenced.</p>

<p>Operational efficiency, customer retention, and cash flow are the name of the game in 2024. So says a survey of about 300 business leaders. And so say many of the PMOs making waves across industries in this time of great economic uncertainty.</p>

<p>Here’s who they are, why we’re keeping an eye on what they’re up to, and what they have to say about the top goals identified in our recent <a href="https://clickup.com/punchup-report">PunchUp Report</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Company</strong>: Rivian<br><strong>Title</strong>: Senior Manager, People PMO</p>



<p>A seasoned project/program manager and PhD-holder, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cathyhoenigphd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cathy Hoenig’s</a> experience with large, complex, <a href="/blog?p=2273">cross-functional initiatives</a> in tech and manufacturing has led her from the University of Phoenix to Boeing to Exemplis and finally Rivian, where she serves as Senior Manager and People PMO.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When it comes to prioritizing employee engagement, Cathy has some solid insights we can all learn a thing or two from. In a recent piece on <a href="https://www.pmi.org/learning/publications/pm-network/digital-exclusives/how-pmos-can-scale-a-change-ready-culture" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">How PMOs Can Scale a Change-Ready Culture</a>, she explained how company culture and her PMO are linked.</p>



<div class="wp-block-clickup-clickup-author-quote cu-author-quote undefined"><blockquote class="cu-author-quote__quote"><p><strong>The people PMO team has a huge influence on directing the culture</strong>. We need to find innovative ways to engage the employees.

<p>It might sound straightforward, but this hyper-focus on directing culture is just the type of simple, elegant solution that makes a real impact. Since hiring Cathy in 2021, Rivian has nearly quadrupled its employee headcount. </p>



<p>Keeping up with that kind of growth requires simple, elegant solutions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As she <a href="https://convene.com/catalyst/company-news/convene-product-engineering-teams/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">explained a few years ago</a>, when it comes to customer retention, designing with the end user in mind is part of her secret sauce.</p>



<div class="wp-block-clickup-clickup-author-quote cu-author-quote undefined"><blockquote class="cu-author-quote__quote"><p>I think we’re taking traditionally mundane experiences, e.g. badging into an office, getting notified about events, finding a meeting room, and attempting to bring some color to how employees interact with physical spaces.

<p><strong>Company</strong>: Dropbox<br><strong>Title</strong>: Senior Director, Global Head of People PMO, People Analytics, and Virtual First at Dropbox</p>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/allison-vendt-1357aa11a/">Allison Vendt</a> is an experienced leader, strategic thinker, and <a href="/blog?p=56106">change management</a>-focused professional leading Dropbox’s shift to Virtual First with a core team of eight. Her rise at Dropbox was preceded by time at The Forem and Stanford, as well as independent consulting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She made it onto our radar both because we’re impressed with Dropbox’s shift and because her insights about customer retention she recently <a href="https://experience.dropbox.com/resources/dropbox-zoom-async-video" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">expressed at her organization</a>.</p>



<div class="wp-block-clickup-clickup-author-quote cu-author-quote undefined"><blockquote class="cu-author-quote__quote"><p>[Virtual work] is about finding new ways to <em>do things better</em>…We made the superpowered shift from busyness to impact…It isn’t about the tasks you complete but about the outcome of that work…First, [we] frame the problem.

<p>In other words, every process change, task, problem framing, and goal should be approached with the knowledge that the end customer’s satisfaction and retention is the goal.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="9-what-are-your-priorities">What Are Your Priorities?</h2>



<p>As we get deeper into Q4 and all the typical yearly planning that comes with the shift to a new calendar year, it’s a great time to dig into what industry leaders have to say about strategic priorities like those above and assess if and how those priorities fit into your strategic landscape for 2024.</p>



<p>According to 300+ industry leaders, the top four priorities are:&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Playing offense with efficiency</li>



<li>Investing in technology to consolidate, automate, and save resources</li>



<li>Prioritizing employee engagement</li>



<li>Planning for long-term customer retention</li>
</ul>



<p>So, how will you incorporate them into your strategy? How do they tie to your organization’s unique vision? And what can you glean from the insights of the PMOs making industry waves?</p>



<p>The answers might start with following the folks above and digging into their insights. And if you haven’t already read the results of that 300+ leader survey, you’ll <a href="https://clickup.com/punchup-report"><strong>find those here</strong></a>–and ready to kick off some inspiration.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="0-why-clickup-ai">Why ClickUp AI?</h2>
<p>We’ve seen massive advances in technology over the past 50 years. From the introduction of personal computers to the widespread adoption of the Internet and smartphones. Each leap has completely changed how people work—and AI will likely be the most transformative development yet.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-economic-potential-of-generative-ai-the-next-productivity-frontier#key-insights" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">new research</a> by McKinsey &amp; Company, AI could automate work activities that take up 60-70% of employees’ time. For professions like customer support, engineering, and marketing, that means their productivity could increase by as much as 45%.</p>
<p>The pace of progress is staggering, to say the least! New breakthroughs are announced every week, and the potential applications seem limitless. <strong>No matter your role, in the near future, you will use AI to help get your work done more <em>efficiently</em>. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f9be.png" alt="🦾" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></strong></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-clickup-ai-is-here-to-transform-your-work">ClickUp AI is Here to Transform Your Work</h2>
<p>Learning any new technology can be overwhelming, and when it comes to using AI, you <em>need</em> to be an expert in speaking its language to unlock true value.</p>
<p>AI can be particular about how you communicate with it. Even with a specific use case in mind, you need to be precise in how you ask for help by sharing the right context and setting the correct dials for tone and creativity.</p>
<p><strong>At ClickUp, we’ve made it significantly simpler and more intuitive to talk with AI.</strong> All of the pre-work has been done for you—all you have to do is open ClickUp to get started.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Time.</p>
<p>Often, we take it for granted until it&#8217;s too late.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m obsessed with saving people time. This passion comes from a series of <a href="https://www.inc.com/magazine/202210/paul-kix/clickup-zeb-evans-dying-to-succeed-2022.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">near-death experiences</a> I was lucky to survive. Each experience reinforced my appreciation of time. It&#8217;s why we started <a href="https://clickup.com">ClickUp</a> 6 years ago.</p>
<p>Time is the most limited resource we&#8217;ll ever have, and it is the only thing you can&#8217;t buy more of&#8230;well maybe, until now.</p>
<p><strong>Today, ClickUp is leapfrogging the productivity industry, with the biggest evolution of AI for work &#8211; ClickUp Brain.</strong></p>
<p>ClickUp Brain is the world&#8217;s first neural network that connects projects, docs, people, and your company’s knowledge with AI.</p>
<p>AI tools are everywhere, but none are saving you time through every step of your workday. ClickUp Brain is deeply embedded in the place you do work, meaning it bridges the gaps and connects the dots across your work, your communication, and your knowledge.</p>
<p>It works like a real brain, using context and institutional knowledge to fundamentally change the way we manage and spend our time.</p>
<p>Consider a world where you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Never have to ask someone what they&#8217;re working on</li>
<li>Never have to write status or progress updates</li>
<li>Never have to search for that PTO policy, process, or form</li>
<li>Respond to people at 2x the speed</li>
<li>Digest long conversations in half the time</li>
<li>Use a writing tool that knows your job and helps you craft, edit, and deliver quality content your company expects</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How much time (and money) do you think you would save?</strong></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s do some math.</p>
<p>Conservatively, if you&#8217;re regaining 2 minutes every time you use AI for the examples I shared:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 minutes x 2,000/day (100-person company) = <strong>24,300 hours is equivalent to more than 1,000 days saved across your company</strong></li>
<li>At $25/hour that&#8217;s <strong>$600,000 per year</strong> in time saved</li>
</ul>
<p>ClickUp Brain is here today, and it&#8217;s available for everyone, without a waitlist, and there&#8217;s a <a href="https://clickup.com/ai">free trial</a>.</p>

<p>Delegate your work about work to ClickUp Brain. Some of the things you can do:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Project Summaries: </strong>Generate status updates, action items, and next steps for any project without any manual work</li>
<li><strong>Personal StandUps:</strong> Know exactly what&#8217;s on your to-do list and share it instantly with your manager or anyone else who needs to know</li>
<li><strong>Team Updates: </strong>Select individuals across your team to gain visibility into their workloads and how the group is progressing toward its goals</li>

<p>ClickUp Community,</p>



<p>It&#8217;s been <strong>six incredible years</strong> since we embarked on our mission with ClickUp 1.0, aiming to <strong>make the world more productive</strong> by building the &#8216;everything app&#8217; for work.</p>



<p>Today, we&#8217;re taking a huge leap forward in realizing this vision, with <strong>ClickUp 3.0 now available for everyone</strong>.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve learned a lot as a company in this journey; our ambitions made us overly optimistic with delivery dates. Over 1,000 passionate ClickUp employees have been working tirelessly to ensure that the most powerful, innovative iteration of ClickUp also delivers you an experience like no other. Today, I&#8217;m incredibly proud to say that we&#8217;ve achieved that goal.</p>



<p>Your feedback and our determination culminated in a product that firmly places ClickUp at the <strong>forefront of innovation</strong> in productivity tools.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="0-performance-and-reliability-the-backbone-of-clickup-30">Performance and Reliability: The Backbone of ClickUp 3.0</h2>



<p>We&#8217;ve completely rebuilt our infrastructure from the ground up. ClickUp 3.0 stands on a foundation of rock-solid reliability and infinite scalability. Our users can now enjoy extreme performance gains, over 99.9% uptime, and real-time updates without the need to refresh the app. This leap forward brings you:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>2x Faster Overall App Performance</li>



<li>3x Faster Task and List Views</li>



<li>5x Faster Search</li>
</ul>



<p>As your Workspace expands, our infrastructure adapts, ensuring continuous optimization and speed enhancements.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-coming-soon-rapidviews-db%E2%84%A2">Coming soon: RapidViews DB<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></h3>



<p>Given the unique nature of ClickUp&#8217;s views and database graph, we&#8217;re the <strong>only platform that can generate and aggregate views across all data</strong> in your Workspace. For example, you can create a view sorting every single task in your Workspace by due date. Other platforms only allow you to do this with a small subset of your Workspace data.</p>



<p>Today, this comes at a cost with sometimes slow loading times for complex views. However, we&#8217;ve developed <strong>innovative new database technology to ensure even the largest and most complex views load almost <em>instantly</em></strong>. We&#8217;re testing this new technology and are seeing incredible results (views that took 30 seconds now take 1 second); <strong>we&#8217;ll roll out RapidViews DB</strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><strong> to 3.0 users in December</strong>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Focus and efficiency are the names of the game.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://clickup.com/punchup-report">54% of business leaders</a> predicting the worst economic downturn in 20 years, it’s clear that <strong>this is a vital moment to look to and learn from industry leaders</strong>. </p>
<p>What are they doing that makes them stand apart? What precautions are they taking for the coming years? And what can we borrow from their winning strategies?</p>
<p>Based on a recent 300-leader survey, those top winning strategies fall into four main categories: </p>
<ol>
<li>Playing offense with efficiency</li>
<li>Investing in technology to consolidate, automate, and save resources</li>
<li>Prioritizing employee engagement</li>
<li>Planning for long-term customer retention</li>
</ol>
<p>Based on those findings, we did some digging into CIOs leading the charge. They’ve got insights on these strategies, wins we can learn from, and careers we think everyone should be paying attention to. </p>
<p>Here are seven of those powerhouse CIOs—and some relevant thoughts from them about these vital strategic priorities:</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="0-what%E2%80%99s-in-a-title">What’s in a Title?</h2>
<p>Similarly to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/dianebrady/2023/03/29/the-forbes-cio-next-list-2023/" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Forbes</a> and their top CIO list, we’ve taken some liberties with who we’re calling CIOs. Instead of titles, we’re more concerned with roles and responsibilities. This is why some of the people on the below list have multiple titles or don’t hold the title of CIO at all. </p>
<p>We’re also choosing to highlight—not rank. These are people doing standout work, but that doesn’t mean they are the <em>only</em> people doing standout work.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-playing-offense-with-efficiency">Playing Offense With Efficiency</h2>
<p>Efficiency is critical for CIOs and similar roles as they manage complex technology environments and big budgets. But how are leaders ensuring IT operations and projects are efficient? And how are they optimizing costs and resources?</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at a few in our list who are answering those tough questions:</p>

<p><strong>Company</strong>: Equity Trust Company<br /><strong>Title</strong>: CIO</p>
<p>A leader in the self-directed account industry, this spring Equity Trust named <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnskish/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">John Kish</a> as their Chief Information Officer. With over 20 years of experience across industries such as automotive and medical—and the strategic mindset that comes with that wealth of experience—we’ve got our eye on John’s commitment to innovation on both the business and technology side of things.  </p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEOjvPNSVxw" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" target="_blank">a recent interview</a>, he spoke on a point that we believe is key for those focused on efficiency. John explained his specific outlook on his efficiency strategy by saying:</p>

<p><strong>Company</strong>: Aprio<br /><strong>Title</strong>: CIO</p>
<p>With a 20+ year career in the industry, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/azunna/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Azunna Anyanwu</a> has focused on delivering solutions and advising executives and corporate boards on technology. Now, he’s the strategic leader behind IT operations, cybersecurity, and infrastructure at Aprio—a business advisory and accounting firm with 20 locations, nearly 2,000 team members, and 50+ countries served. </p>
<p>In 2022, he was the <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aotmp-announces-telecom-mobility-and-it-management-industry-business-award-winners-301531389.html" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" target="_blank">AOTMP</a> IT Management Professional of the Year.</p>
<p>On the efficiency and technology side of things, Azunna’s assessment of what CIOs are working with might ring particularly true. As he says in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/itsm-enables-effective-operations-management-azunna-e-anyanwu/?trackingId=elSwAATNQ0%2BtryScj%2BmivQ%3D%3D" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" target="_blank">recent LinkedIn article</a>: </p>
<div class="wp-block-clickup-clickup-author-quote cu-author-quote undefined" data-quote-color="green">
<blockquote class="cu-author-quote__quote">
<p>“When I start a new role or client project, I frequently find that the team has a shared mailbox or free/barebones incident management system to manage requests for support via email…I also discover that <strong>the information needed to assess the state of the environment is scattered across various tools and systems</strong> (e.g. network-shared drives, intranet, note-taking tools, siloed applications, etc.), or worse, does not even exist. This makes it particularly difficult to identify recurring issues, risks and vulnerabilities or develop a plan for enhancing the effectiveness of the IT organization and environment.” </p>

<p>In other words: Just as our recent report found, consolidation, <a href="https://clickup.com/features/automations">automation</a>, and saving resources via the right technology are paramount challenges to tackle when taking on a new project or coming into a new CIO role.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-investing-in-technology">Investing in Technology</h2>
<p>To maintain a competitive edge, leaders in the technology space have to continually invest in technology to drive business value. Whether it’s driving growth, future-proofing, mitigating risks, or improving efficiency, prioritizing technology is top of mind for these leaders.   </p>

<p><strong>Company:</strong> McKesson Corporation<br /><strong>Title</strong>: Executive VP, CIO, and CTO</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nancy-avila-7283921/">Nancy Avila</a> is another powerhouse with more than two decades of experience to draw from as she leads a team responsible for the technology that keeps McKesson’s vital healthcare services running smoothly. At the height of the COVID crisis, it was McKesson’s e-commerce platform that U.S. regulators chose to distribute vaccines to pharmacies across the states. </p>
<p>And it was Nancy’s team that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/dianebrady/2023/03/29/the-forbes-cio-next-list-2023/" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" target="_blank">scaled distribution by 1500% in just 90 days</a>.  </p>
<p>We love what she has to say about how investing in technology impacts very real outcomes for very real people on the receiving end of our services and products. From a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd65srWBEIs" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">recent interview</a>:</p>

<p>“The other piece [of the role of CIO] is how we optimize our internal operations and platforms in terms of…automation and functions.

Our infrastructure touches our patient…[this is] such an ‘ah-ha’ moment. When our network is down, cancer patients can’t get an infusion. We have to be always on…We transact more orders in pharmaceuticals between the hours of five to nine than Amazon.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="6-prioritizing-employee-engagement">Prioritizing Employee Engagement</h2>
<p>Employee engagement might not always be first to mind with <a href="/blog?p=41151">business technology</a>, but it can be one of the most crucial aspects of a thriving organization. Many technology leaders look to <a href="/blog?p=25597">collaboration tools</a>, devices, and <a href="/blog?p=75770">training software</a> to boost workforce productivity and give employees the right tech to enhance their work. </p>

<p><strong>Company</strong>: JPMorgan Chase</p>

<p>Lori makes those lists for many different reasons—specifically her industry prominence, her management of a $15 billion budget, and her commitment to raising other women in STEM. With 57,000 employees on her tech team and a stellar track record, she’s also a great source of inspiration for those who want to improve employee engagement.</p>
<p>We are particularly struck by her focus on clear, strategic employee communication that centers company strategy. As she said in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bw3jj9cgu74" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" target="_blank">a recent interview</a>:</p>

<p>“That translates into…how we deliver engaging customer experiences [and] how we make sure we’re modernizing our applications, infrastructure, and data,” Beer added.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="9-planning-for-long-term-customer-retention">Planning for Long-Term Customer Retention</h2>

<p><strong>Title</strong>: SVP, Global CIO, and Services and Solutions Group CTO</p>
<p>With 14+ years at Lenovo, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/arthur-hu-b29125/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Arthur Hu</a> has built a strong career leading global IT teams across the value chain and earning big wins for the company along the way. Before Lenovo, this industry heavy hitter spent eight years at McKinsey after graduating from Stanford with a B.S. and then M.S. in Computer Science. </p>
<p>But it’s not just the incredible companies and universities on his resume that led us to include him on this year’s list. It’s the insights he’s been sharing that help frame how CIOs should be thinking about the end customer.</p>
<p>Arthur added context to this idea in a recent <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/649917/lenovos-arthur-hu-on-the-cios-customer-centric-imperative.html" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" target="_blank">interview for CIO Magazine</a>.</p>
<div class="wp-block-clickup-clickup-author-quote cu-author-quote undefined" data-quote-color="green">
<blockquote class="cu-author-quote__quote">
<p><strong>[IT leaders must] adopt a methodology that elevates customer experience as a top-level metric, </strong>on par with technical and functional requirements that technology teams have traditionally been responsible for…This will set in motion a set of changes that will reorient engineering work towards experience, satisfaction, and adoption…</p>

</div>
<p>In the same interview, Arthur adds that enterprise organizations are moving away from a “delivery” process and moving closer to “alignment with outcomes,” which is why customer experience is such a critical factor in the tech world.</p>
<p>“It is no longer enough to manufacture and ship a piece of hardware,” Hu added. “You must provide value by aligning with the customers’ ultimate business goals. <strong>However, you can only pivot to a customer-outcomes mindset if you have an intimate understanding of customer needs and the context in which your technology is being used, which is really where CIOs can play an integral role</strong>.”</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="12-go-forth-and-learn-from-the-best">Go Forth and Learn From the Best</h2>
<p>If you’re trying to prioritize the metrics above (and with 300 leaders saying they’re the key to success in the coming year, we imagine you might be), it’s time to follow and dig into the insights of the CIOs above. </p>
<p>It’s also a great time to revisit how (or if) your strategy incorporates the values of playing offense with efficiency; investing in technology to consolidate, automate, and save resources; prioritizing employee engagement; and planning for long-term customer retention.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been almost three years since ClickUp introduced <a href="/blog?p=9243">Form View</a>. Since then, it&#8217;s become a fan-favorite feature because Forms are the primary way our users capture information from people and bring that data into ClickUp. </p>



<p>Businesses of all types use Forms, from software companies capturing sales leads to auto fleets submitting parts requests. Because the use cases are endless, it can be tricky to configure your Form to get the right information you need from the right people. </p>



<p>We get it. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;ve been hard at work making ClickUp Forms more powerful than ever.</p>



<p><strong>Today, we&#8217;re thrilled to deliver one of our most requested features, Conditional Logic in Forms—an impressive new capability that allows you to create smarter Forms for your most complex workflows.</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="960" height="540" src="https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Conditional-Logic-in-ClickUp-Forms-Product-Feedback-Example.gif" alt="Conditional Logic in ClickUp Forms Product Feedback Example" class="wp-image-55353"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Conditional logic in ClickUp Forms allows you to create smarter Forms to collect data or info like product feedback</figcaption></figure>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="0-what-is-conditional-logic">What is Conditional Logic?</h2>



<p>Conditional Logic allows you to create a single dynamic Form that supports multiple use cases, saving precious time for you and the person filling out the Form!</p>



<p>With Conditional Logic in Forms, you can:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Create one Form</strong>&nbsp;that adapts on the fly based on prior field selections to support a variety of use cases</li>



<li><strong>Streamline Form completion</strong>&nbsp;by only presenting people with the fields relevant to their needs</li>



<li><strong>Handle complex processes</strong>&nbsp;by capturing more precise information from respondents in order to trigger <a href="/blog?p=10150">specific workflows</a> or Automations</li>
</ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="960" height="540" src="https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Example-of-Adding-Conditional-Logic-to-ClickUp-Forms.gif" alt="Example of Adding Conditional Logic to ClickUp Forms" class="wp-image-55354"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Create smarter Forms in ClickUp with Conditional Logic to streamline the process—no matter how complex</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-examples-of-dynamic-forms-that-save-time">Examples of Dynamic Forms That Save Time</h2>



<p>Need some ideas to get you started? Here are a few of the most common ways we see our community using Forms:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Product Feedback</strong>: ClickUp Forms make it easy for product teams to enable users to <a href="https://clickup.com/blog/bug-tracking-software/">report bugs</a>, submit feature requests, or suggest UX improvements. Now with Conditional Logic, they can capture all of this using one Form. Depending on the type of feedback the user is submitting, the Form will present them with the appropriate fields to complete. Pro tip: Use <a href="https://clickup.com/blog/automation-examples/">automations</a> to route feedback to the correct team or even add it to next week&#8217;s sprint.</li>



<li><strong>Creative Requests</strong>: Having trouble getting stakeholders to adopt your team&#8217;s creative asset request process? Using a Form with Conditional Logic can make it simple to get the right inputs like a script for a video, or specs for a new graphic. You&#8217;ll capture exactly the right information, regardless of asset type, and your team will <a href="https://clickup.com/blog/how-to-be-more-productive/">be more productive</a> than ever!</li>



<li><strong>Routing Sales Leads</strong>: Ensure every prospect gets the white glove treatment from your <a href="https://clickup.com/teams/sales">Sales team</a>. With Conditional Logic, you can do things like ask different questions based on the specific product or service a potential customer is interested in, and then route the leads appropriately.</li>



<li><strong>IT Service Requests</strong>: IT Teams can now provide their coworkers with a single Form for all their technology requests, whether your teammate needs access to a new piece of software or a new computer. For example, with Conditional Logic, you can ask employees if they <a href="https://clickup.com/blog/gantt-chart-software-mac/">use a Mac</a> or PC, and based on their selection, present them with either a list of MacOS or Windows OS versions in the next field. You&#8217;ll finally create a streamlined process that&#8217;s painless for everyone involved!</li>
</ol>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="960" height="540" src="https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Conditional-Logic-in-ClickUp-Forms-to-Streamline-Internal-Requests.gif" alt="Conditional Logic in ClickUp Forms to Streamline Internal Requests" class="wp-image-55356"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Streamline internal requests for design or IT teams to collect the exact information needed in your Forms</figcaption></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-supercharge-forms-with-automations">Supercharge Forms With Automations</h2>



<p>As you know, submitting a Form is just the start! Pairing Forms with Automation is where you can really start to fully automate processes across your business, saving enormous amounts of time. </p>



<p>Here are a few of my personal favorite tricks to help you put Forms on autopilot:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Assign Tasks</strong>: Use Conditional Logic in Forms to gather pertinent information about a topic in order to assign the Task to the appropriate team member. For example, you can assign different product feedback tasks based on which <a href="/blog?p=45210">Product Manager</a> owns the relevant feature.</li>



<li><strong>Add Task to Multiple Lists</strong>: Cut down on response time by routing Form submissions to whichever team needs to tackle the work. For example, you might want to send that new computer request to the Onboarding Team&#8217;s list and route the software request to the IT Service Request list.</li>



<li><strong>Apply a Template</strong>: Start with your keys in the ignition and have all your subtasks, assignees, and relationships already set up when a Form submission comes through.</li>



<li><strong>Send Notifications</strong>: Add an @mention comment for someone to review so that the work shows up in their notifications.</li>
</ul>



<p>Whether you&#8217;re looking to gather product feedback, streamline your intake processes, or boost sales efficiency, Conditional Logic in Forms can help you do it. And the best part? This feature is <strong>live now</strong>!</p>

<p>Since we launched ClickUp 2.0 in October 2019, it&#8217;s been an incredible journey. ClickUp 2.0 was <strong>built by and for our community</strong>, and our latest release is no different.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="0-how-we-rebuilt-the-platform-and-what-that-means-for-you">How We Rebuilt the Platform and What That Means for You</h2>



<p>ClickUp&#8217;s platform was pushed to the limits as we quickly scaled to almost 10 million users over the last five years. Our <strong>original architecture simply wasn&#8217;t cutting it anymore</strong>. In the last year and a half, we hired more than 150 engineers and worked intensely to solve this problem.</p>



<p>We built an entirely <strong>new infrastructure</strong> that, first and foremost, provides substantial reliability improvements. The new architecture is designed with infinite scalability in mind and will support us (and you) as we continue to grow into the future and beyond.</p>



<p>Built on three core principles—<strong>reliability, quality, and performance</strong>—we rearchitected our database, shifted to a service-based architecture, and rewrote our WebSocket infrastructure and application code. Here are just a few of the ways you&#8217;ll experience these changes:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Consistent uptime every month, exceeding our promise of 99.99% <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f3c3.png" alt="🏃" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>



<li>Real-time updates, no more refreshing <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f504.png" alt="🔄" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </li>



<li>Task View is 80% faster <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f3a2.png" alt="🎢" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </li>



<li>Notifications load instantly <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f6a4.png" alt="🚤" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>



<li>Search is 3x faster and 7x more relevant <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f50d.png" alt="🔍" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>



<li>Faster views, especially on Spaces and Workspaces <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/26a1.png" alt="⚡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>
</ul>



<p>This also sets us up to deliver important innovations over the next year and ship many of our most requested features like <strong>formulas, relationships, subfolders, and better reporting</strong>.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s so much more to share—check out more details from our SVP of Engineering, Shailesh Kumar, in his <a href="/blog?p=51765" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog post</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-an-inside-look-at-the-new-features-that-will-transform-the-way-you-work">An Inside Look at the New Features That Will Transform the Way You Work</h2>



<p>As we look at the new ClickUp 3.0 product experience, it will feel like an entirely new ClickUp, redesigned with epic improvements and new features.</p>

<p>With ClickUp 3.0, we&#8217;re introducing new capabilities to help you make the most of your time at work. With a stunning new design and an AI-powered assistant at your side, getting work done never felt (or looked) this good.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>ClickUp AI: </strong>Save a ton of time (my most important principle) by automatically generating creative ideas, summarizing lengthy text, and upgrading your writing skills. This is just the start. There&#8217;s much more to come this year with AI.</li>



<li><strong>Universal Search: </strong>Instantly find any file in connected apps (e.g. Google Drive, Slack, Figma) and of course, within ClickUp—all from one place.</li>



<li><strong>Inbox: </strong>Crush your tasks with a redesigned Inbox that highlights your most important notifications and provides a side-by-side view of the associated work.</li>



<li><strong>Home: </strong>Supercharge productivity with a personalized Home that automatically surfaces your most important work first and the context you need to get stuff done faster.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you can <strong>think it, you can build it</strong>. Unleash your creativity to manage <em>anything </em>with the most powerful and customizable version of ClickUp ever with the help of:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Canvas and Cards:</strong> Transform ClickUp into a dynamic surface that you can personalize using portable Cards that let you visualize work your way.</li>



<li><strong>Custom Task Types</strong>: Create custom task types to represent just about anything you want to manage in ClickUp—accounts, cases, SKUs, backlog items, you name it.</li>



<li><strong>Enhanced Automations</strong>: Handle a wider range of use cases with advanced logic and new actions. Plus, enjoy the peace of mind that your Automations trigger in real-time.</li>
</ul>

<figure class="wp-block-video aligncenter"><video controls src="https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/ClickUp-3.0-Universal-Search-Feature.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>Bring your teams, <a href="/blog?p=6165">tools</a>, and knowledge into one place, so that everyone can move faster together to get work done.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>App Center</strong>: Explore, configure, and manage hundreds of integrations from certified partners in one convenient place.</li>



<li><strong>Hubs</strong>: Create a customized view of files and build curated collections that make it easy to access, find, and organize content in one place.</li>



<li><strong>Overviews:</strong> Bring work to light for your teams with Overviews—easily customized homepages that provide a zoomed-out view of the work happening within any Space, Folder, or List.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="6-join-the-clickup-30-waitlist-for-early-access">Join the ClickUp 3.0 Waitlist for Early Access</h2>



<p>We can&#8217;t wait for you to get your hands on the brand-new ClickUp 3.0 experience. It will <strong>launch in two phases</strong>. Starting today, we are rolling out the ClickUp 3.0 <strong>product experience </strong>to Workspaces in beta and will increase the velocity of invites to those on the waitlist over the next several weeks. Separately, Workspaces will begin transitioning to the new ClickUp 3.0 <strong>infrastructure</strong> in March.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll share more details during my keynote at our virtual productivity conference, <a href="https://clickup.com/events/levelup" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">LevelUp</a>! And don&#8217;t forget to sign up for the <a href="http://www.clickup.com/v3" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">ClickUp 3.0 Waitlist</a>.</p>



<p><strong>ClickUp 3.0 is a huge milestone</strong>, and what it unlocks as far as improving quality, finishing existing features, and the innovation to come is what I&#8217;m most excited for you to experience this next year and beyond.</p>
