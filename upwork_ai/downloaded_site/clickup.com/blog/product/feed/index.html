<p><a href="https://www.hygger-online.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Hygger</a> is an <strong>agile project management tool</strong> for creating backlogs, roadmaps, and Kanban boards. When it comes to backlog management, you get access to various free project management templates to kick-start your project with ease. You can organize the backlog using columns, swimlanes, and labels.</p>
<p>It lets you <strong>collect and import insights</strong> from teammates and customers, which you can use to develop new features. </p>
<p>To prioritize features, use the <strong>Weighted Scoring prioritization</strong> method based on Value and Effort factors. You can modify or add custom criteria as well as adjust their weights or opt for ICE or RICE prioritization techniques instead. For easier visualization, use the <strong>Priority matrix</strong>, grouping tasks into Quick wins, Big bets, Timesinks, and Maybes.</p>
<p>After determining their importance, send tasks to your <strong>Development boards</strong>, where you can plan your iterations and track their status and changes. Within each task, teammates can add comments and attachments and log their work. Hygger’s <strong>reporting</strong> lets you analyze metrics, such as time estimated vs. time tracked and team points.</p>

Like other tools on this list, <a href="/blog?p=4965">Microsoft Planner</a> lets you organize and view different aspects of your projects. With the help of its onboarding “wizard”, you can get started and create your first Kanban board, i.e., Plan, in minutes.</p>
<p>While not specifically built as a product backlog management tool, Microsoft Planner can be easily adapted for that purpose, making it a convenient option for teams already using Microsoft 365. </p>
<p>For each Plan, you can create a hierarchy of tasks, assigning them to team members and adding different statuses and milestones. Tasks can be organized into customizable categories called <strong>Buckets</strong>, which can be used to represent various stages or types of backlog management items. </p>
<p>You can drag and drop tasks across Buckets for easy prioritization and status updates. Create new tasks using templates or set up automatic task creation via email. Add comments, tag co-workers in them, and view the history of changes.</p>

<p>It feels like a new marketing tool comes along every week. And data from <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/661020/marketing-technology-revenue/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Statista</a> shows the martech industry worldwide was worth $344.8 billion in 2021. Knowing this, it is no surprise that <a href="https://www.emailmonday.com/marketing-automation-statistics-overview/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">96% of marketers</a> have used a <a href="/blog?p=66890">marketing automation platform</a>.</p>
<p>As a small business owner, you should always look for ways to improve your business. Just like you would <a href="https://www.businessinsuranceusa.com/news/employment/why-your-social-media-presence-matters-when-job-hunting/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">use creative methods</a> to find a new employee, you need to think outside the box to improve your marketing. </p>
<p>And if most marketers use marketing automation platforms, there is certainly something to take away from that. Let’s look into why you should really be using marketing tools in your small business.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-1-marketing-tools-automate-your-workflow-%E2%9A%A1%EF%B8%8F">1. Marketing tools automate your workflow <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/26a1.png" alt="⚡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></h3>
<p>Working nonstop can sometimes make you and your employees feel like you’re on a never-ending hamster wheel and can’t find your way off. And truthfully? You just might be. </p>
<p>It can be hard to step back and look at the bigger picture whenever you are extremely busy with different projects. Are the strategies that you have implemented for marketing working? Is there something you can put into play that will free up your time?</p>

<p><strong>Digital marketing tools that will <a href="/blog?p=53311">automate workflows</a> are certainly something that your marketing staff will be grateful for. </strong></p>
<p>Instead of manually completing every step of a process, good digital marketing tools that will automate workflows will free up their time for bigger and better projects. With workflow automation, employees will benefit from streamlined communication, high-quality work since processes will be less prone to human error, and increased accountability. </p>
<p>All of these benefits will contribute to the overall growth of the department and, therefore, the company. </p>

<p>As a small business, you must measure objectives for your marketing tools and campaigns so you know what works and doesn’t work for you. And with the right marketing tools, you’ll be able to track your goals, measure progress, and maximize your marketing efforts. </p>
<p>As you implement new marketing tools in your small business, be certain that the tools you choose allow you to track your goals. If your end goal is to increase website traffic, for example, define how much traffic you would like to see over a specific amount of time. </p>
<p>Then, for each new tool you implement, <a href="/blog?p=9018">set goals</a> and timelines to measure the tool’s success in your business. </p>

A great way to do that is to establish key result areas for marketing in your small business. <a href="http://clickup.com/blog/marketing-okrs/">Setting marketing OKRs</a> and tracking metrics is another way to measure the success of your marketing efforts and tools. </p>

<p>It’s easy to fall into the hustle and bustle of getting tasks done and turning them in before ( or right on…) the deadline. As a small business, you probably have a lot of employees wearing multiple hats to keep up with the growing demands of your business. </p>
<p>But what happens if someone on the team forgets about a project? Or what if there was a main component of the project that the team didn’t even realize they should be doing?</p>
<p>As a small business owner, you should seek ways to improve productivity and realistic workloads. This is where a <a href="/blog?p=4551">marketing project management tool</a> like <a href="https://clickup.com/">ClickUp</a> comes into play. </p>
<p>You can use <a href="https://clickup.com/templates/project-management-review-kkmvq-6071788">ClickUp’s Project Management Review Template</a> for your team to decide whether to move forward on a project or not.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="70-what-to-look-for-when-choosing-marketing-tools">What to Look for When Choosing Marketing Tools</h2>
<p>With so many options out there, it can take a lot of work to know which ones are worth investing time and money in and which ones you should pass on.  When looking for small business marketing tools,<strong> </strong>here are some key features every marketing tool should have<strong>. </strong></p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="71-user-friendliness-and-functionality-%E2%80%8D">User-friendliness and functionality <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f469-200d-1f4bb.png" alt="👩‍💻" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></h3>
<p>A program may be spectacular and have many great features, but if it <strong>isn’t user-friendly, you should probably pass </strong>on it. </p>
<p>Regardless of what the tool promises, you should be able to access it and easily learn how to use the app or the website. Additionally, if a tool provides great how-to and tutorials with snapshots of navigating the tool, that’s a great bonus. </p>
<p>The last thing you want to do is invest in a tool only to realize then how much time you will have to put into learning how it works. </p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="72-practicality-vs-cost-">Practicality vs. cost <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f4b0.png" alt="💰" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></h3>
<p>Whatever program you decide to use should be practical.  </p>
<p>Always weigh out the tool’s practicality for you and your team’s use versus the cost. <strong>Decide if the features are actually something you will use</strong> or if they are just an added benefit that you do not need or are irrelevant to your needs.</p>
<p>If the practicality and use do not outweigh the costs, then you should continue your search for marketing tools that are good for your use. </p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="73-scalability-and-flexibility-">Scalability and flexibility <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f4c8.png" alt="📈" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></h3>
<p>Your marketing tools should be flexible enough to accommodate your current needs and adjust with you as your business scales. So when searching for cutting-edge tools, look for tools that offer <a href="https://clickup.com/custom-project-management">customization options</a> and a wide range of features that can help with simple to complex tasks.</p>
<p>In other words,<strong> don’t invest in a tool that only resolves your issues now.</strong> Instead, look for a long-term solution that can support your current <em>and</em> future business needs.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="74-level-up-your-small-business-by-having-the-right-tools">Level Up Your Small Business by Having the Right Tools</h2>
<p>Marketing tools are something that every small business should implement. Free up time for your marketing team to focus on bigger and great projects. </p>
<p>If you take away anything from this list, really consider the features of each tool and try to find one that checks off the most boxes so your team relies on fewer tools. If you’re still missing some critical features, make sure the tool can at least integrate seamlessly into your preferred platform.  </p>
<p>ClickUp can integrate with more than 1,000 different applications through Zapier. In addition, Zapier handles the automatic transfer of data so you do not have to worry about each little step of the way. </p>
<p>Choose the right marketing tool to reach new customers, achieve and crush your marketing goals, and take your small business to a new world of efficiency. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="0-what-should-you-look-for-in-a-study-tool-"><strong>What Should You Look for in a Study Tool?</strong></h2>
<p>Here are the things you should look for in a study tool:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>User-friendly interface:</strong> Look for a tool with an intuitive and user-friendly interface. A tool that is easy to navigate will <a href="/blog?p=120843">save time</a> and reduce frustration</li>
<li><strong>Compatibility and accessibility:</strong> Ensure the tool is compatible with the devices and operating systems you use (e.g., Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android). It should also be accessible across multiple devices to allow for flexibility in your study environment</li>
<li><strong>Collaboration features: </strong>If you are a college student who often collaborates with others on projects or study groups, choose a tool that supports collaboration features such as real-time editing, commenting, and file sharing</li>
<li><strong>Note-taking capabilities:</strong> Look for a study tool that allows you to take organized and searchable notes, and it’s a bonus if it supports multimedia elements like images and audio recordings</li>
<li><strong>Learning resources:</strong> Some study tools have built-in learning resources, such as flashcards, quizzes, or pre-made study materials. Evaluate whether these resources align with your education</li>
<li><strong>Progress tracking:</strong> Look for tools that provide features for tracking your progress. This could include analytics, statistics, or visual representations of your achievements and areas for improvement.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s jump in!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="0-what-are-okrs">What Are OKRs?</h2>



<p>OKR (Objectives and Key Results) is a goal-setting framework that helps a business define individual and company goals while devising a way to measure them.</p>



<p>The OKR framework has two components:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Objectives:</strong> Goals that specify what you want to achieve</li>



<li><strong>Key results:</strong> Metrics that track your progress towards meeting your objectives</li>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="23-three-benefits-of-okrs">Three Benefits of OKRs</h3>



<p>Sure,&nbsp;Google&nbsp;and tons of other businesses use&nbsp;OKRs&nbsp;to manage their&nbsp;company goals.&nbsp;But&nbsp;why&nbsp;do they use it?&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="24-1-fast-to-create-and-easy-to-use">1. Fast to create and easy to use</h4>



<p>Many companies take weeks trying to&nbsp;develop&nbsp;a large-scale&nbsp;goal&nbsp;instead of spending time actually achieving that&nbsp;goal.</p>



<p>But writing OKRs is no biggie – you just need to identify an objective, its key results and the initiatives you’ll take to achieve them.</p>



<p>Moreover,&nbsp;OKRs&nbsp;are super&nbsp;simple&nbsp;to use.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You <a href="/blog?p=55815">break down a&nbsp;measurable&nbsp;objective</a>&nbsp;into&nbsp;simple&nbsp;results that help you quickly&nbsp;determine&nbsp;if you achieved the&nbsp;objective&nbsp;or not.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="25-2-boosts-focus-and-commitment-to-goals-">2.&nbsp;Boosts&nbsp;focus&nbsp;and commitment&nbsp;to goals&nbsp;</h4>



<p>When you&nbsp;set OKRs, you’re limiting your focus to&nbsp;specific&nbsp;objectives and&nbsp;key results.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, your company can&nbsp;set&nbsp;two&nbsp;annual OKRs&nbsp;— each with four&nbsp;key results.</p>



<p>This way, all the&nbsp;team&nbsp;has to&nbsp;focus&nbsp;on is tackling those 8 key results throughout the year!</p>



<p>And <a href="/blog?p=73859">when you’re able to&nbsp;focus</a>&nbsp;on the&nbsp;objective, you can fully&nbsp;commit&nbsp;to it.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="26-3-the-bi-directional-approach-helps-you-align-goals-better-">3.&nbsp;The bi-directional approach&nbsp;helps you&nbsp;align&nbsp;goals better&nbsp;</h4>



<p>In most companies,&nbsp;top-level&nbsp;management&nbsp;decides what the goals are and everyone else has to follow.</p>



<p>This is a cascading approach to&nbsp;goal setting.</p>



<p>When your goals only contain top-level&nbsp;management&nbsp;insights, you fail to&nbsp;align&nbsp;them to your employee’s&nbsp;own&nbsp;goals, reducing&nbsp;employee engagement.</p>



<p>But when you’re&nbsp;setting OKRs,&nbsp;it’s another story.</p>



<p>Instead of a cascading approach, the process is&nbsp;bi-directional — the&nbsp;OKR setting process&nbsp;includes everyone in the company! Here, the top management and everyone else relate their objectives and&nbsp;key results&nbsp;together&nbsp;to make a cohesive plan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can also create&nbsp;company wide OKRs&nbsp;— where&nbsp;the&nbsp;whole&nbsp;organization&nbsp;commits to the same goals, like the&nbsp;company’s mission.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="27-committed-vs-aspirational-okrs">Committed vs. Aspirational OKRs</h3>



<p>There are two types of goals in the OKR methodology you should know: <strong>committed</strong> and <strong>aspirational</strong>.</p>



<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f91d.png" alt="🤝" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Committed OKRs</strong></p>



<p>Committed OKRs are the agreed-upon goals prioritized to reach company success. People, resources, and schedules are rearranged to ensure they get done. Companies want to achieve 100% of their committed OKRs.</p>



<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f314.png" alt="🌔" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Aspirational OKRs</strong></p>



<p>Aspirational OKRs (moonshots) are ambitious and more challenging to accomplish, but they push us to think outside the box and innovate. Unlike committed OKRs, they don’t have a clear path for completion or actual knowledge of how to get there. So if you’ve completed at least 70% of your aspirational OKRs, consider it a success!</p>



<p><em>To learn more about the fundamentals of OKRs, check out our <a href="/blog/?p=5117">detailed post on OKRs</a>.</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="28-okr-writing-tips">OKR Writing Tips</h2>



<p>Regardless of what industry or market you’re in, competitors are consistently grabbing opportunities to address the pain points of your shared target audience. If you plan to stay ahead of the competition, your team must have the most straightforward direction, resources, and metrics.</p>



<p>This is why writing effective OKRs is important to understand how their daily work and performance impact the bigger picture. No one wants to spend time on projects that shouldn’t have been started in the first place. Or waste hours of their day digging for information to get their tasks completed.</p>



<p>Before we dive into how to create OKRs, let’s walk through the difference between objectives, key results, and tasks.</p>



<p><em>Wait—aren’t key results the same as tasks? </em><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f633.png" alt="😳" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>Key results are outcomes, not tasks. (Hint: this is where you’ll convert <em>good OKRs</em> to <em>effective OKRs</em>!)</p>



<p>You’ve most likely seen this OKR formula: <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2b07.png" alt="⬇" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>I will __________ (objective), as measured by __________ (key result).</strong></p>



<p>A trick to help differentiate a key result and task is to remember:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Key result = goal post <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f945.png" alt="🥅" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>



<li>Task = the tactics/activities to get there <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f93e-200d-2640-fe0f.png" alt="🤾‍♀️" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>
</ul>



<p>Now we know the distinction between an objective, key result, and task, let’s dive into the writing tips!</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="29-tip-1-choose-between-3-5-objectives-"><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f3c6.png" alt="🏆" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Tip #1: Choose between 3-5 objectives</strong></h4>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>An objective answers the question: What’s the immediate problem, change, or desired outcome we want?</li>



<li>Aim for quarterly instead of annual objectives to manage targets easier</li>



<li>Encourage your teams to send you their prioritized list of problems and issues</li>



<li>Does the written objective leave no room for interpretation? (If everyone answers differently, this means the objective is not aligning)</li>
</ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="30-tip-2-choose-between-3-5-key-results-per-objective-"><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f3af.png" alt="🎯" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Tip #2: Choose between 3-5 key results per objective</strong></h4>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>A key result answers the question: How will we know if we met our objective?</li>



<li>Each key result is time-bound, specific, and includes a number</li>



<li>The teams should design and write the key results—not senior leadership. Teams are the subject-matter experts and owners of the work</li>



<li>Assign a Key Results champion to monitor and lead weekly/monthly OKR check-in meetings</li>
</ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="31-tip-3-use-distinct-and-basic-terminology-"><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f4d8.png" alt="📘" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Tip #3: Use distinct and basic terminology</strong></h4>



<p>Objectives and key results should be easy for others to understand. Unfortunately, company jargon excludes people that don’t have the resources to decode, and it’s not productive (or fair!) to rely on employees to ask what it means.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="32-tip-4-communicate-to-foster-a-great-corporate-culture-"><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f4ac.png" alt="💬" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Tip #4: Communicate to foster a great corporate culture</strong></h4>



<p>Companies should use an employee communication platform available on both mobile and desktop to meet the <a href="/blog?p=52672">needs of a hybrid workforce</a>. This is also an opportunity for employees to learn about big and small wins from different departments too. Here are a few places to mention OKRs:</p>

<p>Let’s admit it: No, the product does not sell itself. Even the best products in the world have significant marketing, sales, and distribution efforts behind them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But here&#8217;s the catch, companies that create great products build their marketing and sales <em>around</em> the product—a business strategy called product-led growth. In the world of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), product-led growth (PLG) is one of the most popular yet elusive strategies.</p>



<p>So, what’s the secret to product-led growth? To find out, we need to enter the hallowed portals of PLG SaaS. Let&#8217;s go. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f680.png" alt="🚀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="0-what-is-product-led-growth-plg-"><strong>What Is Product-Led Growth (PLG)?</strong></h2>



<p>Product-led growth is a SaaS marketing strategy that leverages the product as the foundation of go-to-market initiatives. The entire organization, including sales, marketing, customer success, design, and development, aligns to create sticky products that drive growth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Critical characteristics of a product-led strategy include:&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Self-service</strong>: Users discover and use the product independently, without the need for the organization to interject</li>



<li><strong>UX-driven</strong>: Products are designed to deliver immediate value to customers, getting them hooked on the first trial</li>



<li><strong>Freemium subscription</strong>: The goal of the free trial is to get users to upgrade to paid versions as a result of good user experience</li>



<li><strong>Democratized decisions</strong>: Product-led companies rely on feedback from existing customers to make design/development-related decisions</li>



<li><strong>Customer advocacy</strong>: PLG relies on word-of-mouth, virality, and online discovery to acquire and retain paying customers</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-how-did-plg-emerge">How did PLG emerge?</h3>



<p>Product-led growth is the result of several historical and emerging changes in the software market. </p>



<p><strong>Purchase decisions</strong>: To begin with, the decisions around organizational software today are democratized. Users have a bigger say in what tools organizations buy. Teams—sometimes even individuals—choose their own toolkits to get work done faster and better.</p>



<p><strong>UX trends</strong>: The days of ugly, unusable enterprise software have made way for modern, user-centric designs—a hallmark of today’s B2B tech. UX has become a key differentiating factor.</p>



<p><strong>Subscription models</strong>: Today, nearly all software is paid for through periodic subscriptions. This removes the financial obstacles to trying our various options before making decisions.</p>



<p><strong>Self-service or no-service mindset</strong>: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2023-10-30-adapting-to-the-customer-service-preferences-of-gen-z-and-millennials" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gartner found</a> that if the needs of GenZ and millennial customers weren&#8217;t met in self-service, they would use the product less, never buy from the company again, and say negative things about the product.</p>



<p>In response to these market trends, organizations turned to <a href="https://clickup.com/blog/growth-marketing-strategies/">growth marketing strategies</a> that engaged users, allowed them to buy independently, delivered impressive UX, and encouraged them to upgrade. Thus, PLG was born.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-what-does-it-mean-to-be-a-product-led-saas-company">What does it mean to be a product-led SaaS company?</h3>



<p>A product-led company is unique in that almost everyone is responsible for growth. Here’s how.</p>



<p><strong>Unified org structure</strong>: PLG, as a strategy, unifies the entire organization. It breaks down the silos between product, sales, marketing, etc., to rally the whole company toward growth.</p>



<p><strong>Product-focused communication</strong>: When the product is the primary driver of growth, the strategy shifts from traditional sales and marketing to creating a platform that effectively showcases the product.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, as part of a launch, a cross-functional team would collaborate to create customer-centric content, such as:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>A well-designed, engaging website that centers around the product</li>



<li>Use-case-based product demos</li>



<li>Personalized landing pages focused on the different value propositions for different user personas</li>



<li>Streamlined trials</li>



<li>Easy (often free) signup </li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Continuous improvement</strong>: PLG teams collaboratively iterate on UX through experimentation. They study user behavior, adoption, abandonment, etc., to devise mitigating strategies. </p>



<p><strong>Redefined marketing and sales</strong>: In product-led companies, especially in <a href="https://clickup.com/blog/b2b-saas-enterprise-software/">B2B SaaS enterprise software</a>, marketing’s role centers around product education, user experience, and customer engagement, while sales teams focus on custom solutions and upsell.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-how-is-product-led-growth-different-from-other-traditional-growth-strategies">How is product-led growth different from other traditional growth strategies?</h3>



<p><strong>Traditional growth strategies delineate sales from the product.</strong> In sales-led or customer-led growth, the product team builds the product, and the marketing/sales team takes it to market. Product-led growth changes that and, in doing so, differentiates itself from other <a href="https://clickup.com/blog/saas-marketing-strategies/">SaaS marketing strategies</a> in several ways.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><thead><tr><th>Parameter</th><th><strong>Product-led</strong></th><th><strong>Sales-led</strong></th><th><strong>Customer-led</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Driver</td><td>Product</td><td>Sales team&nbsp;</td><td>Customer feedback and satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td>Onboarding</td><td>Self-serve product guides&nbsp;</td><td>Demos and installations led by the sales team</td><td>Setup and adoption led by the customer success team</td></tr><tr><td>Customer acquisition cost</td><td>Low because of inbound and self-serve customer journeys</td><td>High including the cost of sales</td><td>Medium, with higher focus on retention and recurring revenue&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Scalability</td><td>High: Product virality leads to more adoption</td><td>Moderate: Adoption limited by sales team capacity&nbsp;</td><td>High: Customer satisfaction can lead to organic growth</td></tr><tr><td>Product development</td><td>Iterative and based on data from product usage</td><td>Based on sales feedback and customer satisfaction</td><td>Based on direct customer feedback</td></tr><tr><td>Customer relationship&nbsp;</td><td>The relationship is with the product, with minimal interaction with customer service (as needed)</td><td>The relationship is with the sales reps, often close and collaborative</td><td>The relationship is with customer success teams, through continuous engagement&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Differences between product-led, sales-led, and customer-led strategies</figcaption></figure>



<p>While these three strategies look distinct from one another, they are not mutually exclusive. Some of the most successful organizations take a hybrid approach, using and combining the best parts of these models, based on their current context. </p>


<div class="wp-block-ub-styled-box ub-styled-box ub-notification-box" id="ub-styled-box-91f06b7f-db58-49ac-a3b9-2f196296abb0">


<p id="ub-styled-box-notification-content-">For instance, a productivity tool might use PLG for individual/small business customers and a sales-led growth approach for enterprises that seek customizations and support.&nbsp;</p>


</div>


<p>B2B SaaS businesses often begin as sales-led companies, slowly transitioning to product-led when marketing strategies like SEO, social media, content, etc. gain traction online.</p>



<p>Whether you use PLG on its own or in combination with other methods, keep in mind that your strategy needs a foundation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-the-pillars-of-product-led-growth-"><strong>The Pillars of Product-Led Growth</strong></h2>



<p>Product-led growth relies on the software to attract, engage, and retain customers. The product drives virality, onboarding, engagement, and stickiness. To achieve this, businesses need to build their product on the following three pillars.</p>


<div class="wp-block-ub-styled-box ub-styled-box ub-bordered-box" id="ub-styled-box-8a8e724e-f2b5-4c61-91ed-2d46b44a6d63">


<p id="ub-styled-box-bordered-content-">The product-led approach is about your users finding the “Aha!” moment. This drives product onboarding, usability, and virality. </p>


</div>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-1-user-driven-design">1. User-driven design</h3>



<p>To attract and keep your customers, you need to build for their needs and solve their most pressing problems. To get started with this, create a fantastic UX throughout the customer journey.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Invest in UX research to build intuitive products</li>



<li>Observe product usage patterns to understand customers better</li>



<li><strong>Make onboarding effortless</strong> for the user. For instance, you might want to avoid a blank slate on signup and offer templates/placeholders for users to customize</li>



<li>Study drop-offs, exits, and reduction in usage throughout the customer’s life cycle</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="6-2-value-focus">2. Value-focus</h3>



<p><a href="https://clickup.com/blog/saas-tools/">SaaS tools</a> typically offer pay-as-you-go plans or monthly rolling contracts. This means that the customer can leave at any point with very little cost of doing so. To retain a customer in such scenarios, a product needs to deliver value consistently and regularly.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Use <strong>freemium or free trial pricing</strong> to give your users a chance to experience the product without upfront costs</li>



<li>Hone the product’s ‘Aha moment,’ the point at which it delivers value every single time the user logs in</li>



<li>Build the product to offer incremental value to the customer and add new features to compound customer value</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="7-3-go-to-market-intent">3. Go-to-market intent</h3>



<p>To get development and growth work in tandem, you need two-way collaboration. Enable that deliberately.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Invest in resources to make quick iterations and build products in response to customer feedback</li>



<li>Bring sales, marketing, product, and engineering to the same page. This could be as simple as using the same virtual workspace/project management tool&nbsp;</li>



<li>Build a product marketing practice</li>
</ul>



<p>Product-led pillars also promote SaaS growth by widening the top of the sales funnel and encouraging more users to move down by delivering value upfront and making it easy to see results. But that’s not all.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="8-benefits-of-product-led-growth-"><strong>Benefits of Product-Led Growth&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2>


<div class="wp-block-ub-styled-box ub-styled-box ub-notification-box" id="ub-styled-box-f3259e1d-ee0b-4465-b7fa-4b9dc8c07483">


<p id="ub-styled-box-notification-content-"><strong>Fact Check</strong>: A recent study found that <a href="https://productled.com/blog/product-led-growth-benchmarks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">91% of companies</a> plan to increase investment in product-led growth. <a href="https://www.bain.com/insights/what-it-really-takes-to-develop-product-led-growth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">75% of senior leaders</a> at B2B SaaS companies are “concerned about competition from PLG companies,&#8221; and with good reason!</p>


</div>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="9-1-lower-customer-acquisition-costs-cac">1. Lower customer acquisition costs (CAC)</h3>



<p>For starters, PLG dramatically reduces customer acquisition costs. With free trials, self-serve onboarding, content-driven engagement, automation, and limited sales team interactions, PLG companies reduce personnel costs and overhead. This reduces CAC.</p>



<p><strong>For example, Zoom offers a free version with usage limitations, reducing barriers to trial.</strong> The product is intuitive and easy to use. When users are impressed by the experience, they upgrade themselves without a single conversation with a sales representative.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="10-2-faster-and-more-scalable-customer-growth">2. Faster and more scalable customer growth</h3>



<p><a href="https://www.bain.com/insights/what-it-really-takes-to-develop-product-led-growth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bain &amp; Company found that</a> companies using a product-led growth strategy made higher revenue than those who didn’t. And that is by design.</p>



<p>In product-led growth, scaling the user base doesn’t depend on the number of salespeople you employ. So, businesses can onboard more users with fewer resources and drive faster growth. In addition, <a href="https://clickup.com/blog/plg-companies/">PLG companies</a> create wider reach through <strong>viral content, word-of-mouth, customer referrals, upgrades,</strong> etc.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="11-3-shorter-sales-cycle">3. Shorter sales cycle</h3>



<p>A strong product-led growth strategy creates a business model less reliant on elaborate, expensive sales processes. In a PLG journey, a prospect:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Searches/hears about a product</li>



<li>Reads up on it, looks at reviews</li>



<li>Signs up for a free trial</li>



<li>Tries the product</li>



<li>Turns into a paying customer through a paid upgrade</li>
</ol>



<p>Steps 1-4—i.e., prospects becoming product-qualified leads—can happen as quickly as within a day or even a single session on the website, unhindered by the availability of a salesperson. </p>



<p>While step 5 might take weeks or even months to reach, it is a confirmation of the value that the customer gains from the product. This creates <strong>recurring revenue, increasing the customer lifetime value (CLV)</strong>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="12-4-higher-revenue-potential">4. Higher revenue potential</h3>



<p>When compared to companies using traditional growth strategies, product-led businesses have <a href="https://www.emergeagency.com/digital-product-strategy-for-saas-business/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">60% more Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)</a>. Letting users discover, experience, commit to, and spread the word about the product provides customers with a more significant source of satisfaction and ownership.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="13-5-higher-revenue-per-employee">5. Higher revenue per employee</h3>



<p>In a SaaS business, headcount is one of the biggest costs. Highly skilled employees are expensive to hire and retain. To measure efficiency and ROI on employee costs, SaaS companies measure the average revenue per employee (ARPE).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Product-led growth minimizes employee costs by enabling discovery, self-serve, and automation. This increases revenue per employee when compared to businesses with large sales and customer support teams.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="14-6-lower-churn">6. Lower churn</h3>



<p>PLG, by design, relies on the strength of the product for acquisition and retention, through the consistent value delivered by the product. As a result, the customer makes the purchase decision independently and gradually.</p>



<p>So, there is no risk of being pressured or swayed by a salesperson. There is less likelihood of buyer’s remorse. This reduces churn, keeping up customer lifetime value.</p>



<p>If the above feel like good enough reasons to implement a product-led growth strategy in your organization, here’s how you can.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="15-how-to-implement-plg-in-saas-"><strong>How to Implement PLG in SaaS</strong></h2>



<p>At its core, product-led growth is about aligning the way product, marketing, sales, and customer success do things. Achieving that needs a strategic approach and a robust <a href="https://clickup.com/teams/product">product management tool like ClickUp</a>. Let’s see how you can implement PLG in your SaaS organization.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="16-1-design-the-product-to-deliver-immediate-value">1. Design the product to deliver immediate value</h3>



<p>For a product to be sticky, it needs to solve the customer&#8217;s problem immediately, as soon as they sign up for the trial. You can enable that by:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Simplifying core features, making them intuitive and easy to use</li>



<li>Optimizing the ‘Aha moment,’ the point of value</li>



<li>Reducing complexity, keep the UI clean and journey seamless</li>



<li>Making transitioning from another product effortless through integrations and imports</li>

<p>Product teams use <a href="https://clickup.com/features/whiteboards">ClickUp Whiteboards</a> to visually map user journeys and identify Aha moments along the way. From here, they take a top-down approach to build features and drill down on capabilities.</p>



<p>In essence, a good customer journey visualization helps the entire growth team, including product, align on the third pillar of PLG: Go-to-market intent.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="17-2-price-for-value">2. Price for value</h3>



<p>Once you’ve built a great product, offer it for free so users can pay only if they see value. You can do this with:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>A<strong>fFreemium model</strong>: Prospects try a basic version of the product for free and only pay for advanced features/upgrades</li>



<li><strong>Free trial</strong>: Prospects use the product free for a limited time&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>In-product upsell</strong>: As users engage with the product, show them upsell opportunities at the right price and time&nbsp;</li>
</ul>


<div class="wp-block-ub-styled-box ub-styled-box ub-notification-box" id="ub-styled-box-fc20167e-fed1-4f5b-84f7-054e4eec5ad4">


<p id="ub-styled-box-notification-content-">A great example of this is <strong>Figma</strong>. The product offers limited features in the free version, inviting professional designers to upgrade for more. However, it allows other users, like managers, reviewers, etc. free access on a browser-based platform, making collaboration easy and free. </p>


</div>


<p>In this pricing structure, customers see that they’re paying for exactly what they need, i.e., great design capabilities, a feature that consistently delivers value.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="18-3-polish-the-onboarding-pathway">3. Polish the onboarding pathway</h3>



<p>A seamless onboarding experience is the foundation of product-led growth. Make it simple, easy, and self-serve.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="19-educate-"><strong>Educate</strong></h4>



<p>Hubspot is the perfect example of a SaaS startup that is built around educating prospects. The <a href="https://clickup.com/blog/crm-saas/">CRM SaaS</a> platform creates a range of content not just in its blogs and reports but also through webinars, learning programs, and certifications. </p>



<p>Take inspiration from Hubspot to create substantial resources in the form of videos, podcasts, whitepapers, case studies, etc. to educate the prospect about the pathway. Use <a href="https://clickup.com/blog/product-marketing-software/">product marketing software</a> to ensure prospects have all the information they need at the click of a button.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1200" height="684" src="https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/ClickUp-Tasks-6.png" alt="ClickUp Tasks" class="wp-image-217641" srcset="https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/ClickUp-Tasks-6.png 1200w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/ClickUp-Tasks-6-300x171.png 300w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/ClickUp-Tasks-6-768x438.png 768w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/ClickUp-Tasks-6-700x399.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>ClickUp Tasks to manage content marketing for PLG</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p><a href="https://clickup.com/features/tasks">ClickUp Tasks</a> is a great way to manage your content marketing pipeline to power PLG. Organize your content schedule with Tags, Custom Fields, Custom Statuses, and more with ClickUp.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="20-empower-"><strong>Empower</strong></h4>



<p>The USP of product-led marketing is the ability to onboard users without hand-holding. Enable an intuitive and enjoyable self-serve signup process for your users. Roll out the red carpet, and they will walk it. </p>



<p>A vast majority of millennial and Gen Z users want to experience the product on their own. Leave them at peace to do this. If necessary, use an onboarding tool like Pendo.io and Userflow to streamline this.</p>



<p>Slack is another super successful <a href="https://clickup.com/blog/saas-examples/">SaaS example</a>. The product in itself is easy to understand and use. Slack elevates that experience with a bot that offers guided onboarding, without the interference of a salesperson. Slack’s PLG strategy integrates onboarding support within the product itself.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="21-engage-"><strong>Engage</strong></h4>



<p>In some cases, a prospect might need support. If the product is complex or the user is unfamiliar with similar software, they might seek help. For these users, create prompts to guide them during sign-up. </p>



<p>For each repeat use, design in-app tutorials with product tours and access to tips where users can learn about the product at their own pace. Make sure not to overwhelm your users with too many features or too much information upfront. For those who need it, offer customized demos as well.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="22-4-set-up-systems-to-collect-customer-feedback">4. Set up systems to collect customer feedback</h3>



<p>Get the basics right. Set up surveys and questionnaires to collect feedback on usage. </p>


<div class="wp-block-ub-styled-box ub-styled-box ub-notification-box" id="ub-styled-box-85d5e8c7-11f8-4dde-958d-2a3204c79c0b">


<p id="ub-styled-box-notification-content-">A net promoter score (NPS) survey, for example, can help you understand if product updates have affected the product experience. </p>

<p><a href="https://clickup.com/features/form-view">ClickUp Forms</a> is a simple way to set up and run these surveys. Create simple questionnaires, share them securely, collect relevant data, and directly convert them into Tasks, if necessary.</p>



<p>In addition to surveys, set up tools to track user behavior.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Use web analytics tools to understand user journeys</li>



<li>Leverage product analytics to know the time spent on features, drop-off points, cohort behavior, etc.</li>



<li>Run A/B tests on different onboarding flows, carousels, and messaging</li>



<li>Follow social media and community forums to learn about what users are saying about the product</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="23-5-enable-collaboration-among-cross-functional-teams">5. Enable collaboration among cross-functional teams</h3>



<p>The foundation of PLG is for product and growth to function as one unit. However, most companies, SaaS included, organize their people in teams of marketing, sales, customer success, and product—in other words, the traditional way. So, often, there is a lack of context, which affects consensus.</p>



<p>Avoid this by bringing all PLG teams together on a virtual workspace like ClickUp.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Plan</strong>: Record meeting notes and feedback on <strong>ClickUp Docs</strong>. Brainstorm on <strong>ClickUp Mind Maps.</strong> Use <strong>ClickUp Dashboards</strong> to track performance on metrics that matter to you.</p>

<p><strong>Automate</strong>: Streamline and automate grunt work.

Free up the cross-functional team to focus on the creative aspects of the PLG strategy.</p>



<p>As effective as it is, product-led growth is also complex. It requires cultural, behavioral, and logistical changes organization-wide. That would be the first of a few challenges you’re likely to face.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="24-overcoming-challenges-and-setting-a-successful-plg-strategy-"><strong>Overcoming Challenges and Setting a Successful PLG Strategy&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Here are some of the common challenges you might face when implementing a product-led growth strategy and ways to overcome them.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="25-aha-moment-too-late">Aha moment too late</h3>



<p><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Challenge: </mark></strong>In PLG, a customer reaching the ‘aha moment’ is critical to their adoption and retention. If a customer doesn’t get there fast enough, the entire PLG strategy will crumble.</p>



<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f6e0.png" alt="🛠" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color">Solution</mark></strong>: Prevent this with thorough research and user-centric product design. Focus on creating aha moments for each persona and improve on this consistently. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="26-self-service-gone-sour">Self-service gone sour</h3>



<p><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Challenge: </mark></strong>While customers in this generation prefer self-service, they are also likely to leave if they’re unable to find something on their own. For instance, if they can’t find information about importing data from another tool, they might abandon their sign up.</p>



<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f6e0.png" alt="🛠" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color">Solution</mark></strong>: Avoid this with the right balance of self-service and customer support. As the first port of call, build an automated workflow in-app to encourage users to explore features and provide tips. </p>



<p>You can also deploy a bot to do this. But always ensure that guided onboarding is available in case a customer needs it.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="27-sub-optimal-trial-lengths">Sub-optimal trial lengths</h3>



<p><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Challenge:</mark></strong> Free trials forever are not profitable. Not long enough trials are not helpful to the user. A successful SaaS company needs to identify the perfect pricing strategy.</p>



<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f6e0.png" alt="🛠" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color">Solution</mark></strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-black-color"><strong>:</strong> </mark>Run experiments to arrive at the right pricing/trial strategy. Design limited period offers/access to understand the response. For instance, you can create a Black Friday deal offering a 90-day extension to the AI trial.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="28-unsuitable-organization-design">Unsuitable organization design</h3>



<p><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Challenge:</mark></strong> Every organization is built as a collection of teams. As the teams get bigger, natural silos are formed, obstructing the flow of information. In PLG, this can creates disjunctures in the customer experience.</p>



<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f6e0.png" alt="🛠" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color">Solution</mark></strong>: Avoid this with collaborative workspaces. Share data openly and transparently. Build a culture of documentation.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="29-feedback-not-actioned-">Feedback not actioned </h3>



<p><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Challenge:</mark></strong> A good PLG strategy is cyclical and iterative. Small product teams closely observe customers, speak to them, and collect feedback. With scale, the feedback mechanisms are scattered, creating splinters in the cycle.</p>



<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f6e0.png" alt="🛠" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color">Solution</mark></strong>: Build and hone systems to capture feedback. Build a community where customers can share insights, ask questions, and support. Participate in <a href="https://clickup.com/blog/saas-conferences/">SaaS conferences</a> for some peer feedback.</p>



<p>Include feedback as part of product development retrospectives. Use this data to create the product roadmap.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Product-led growth for SaaS is, in many ways, user-centric growth</strong>. It offers a compelling value proposition. Once the challenges are ironed out, the approach can help drive better product adoption, engagement, and growth in the competitive startup landscape.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="30-embracing-the-shift-towards-user-centric-saas-solutions-via-plg-"><strong>Embracing the Shift Towards User-Centric SaaS Solutions Via PLG</strong></h2>



<p>Product-led growth has been fundamentally transforming the SaaS landscape. It has shifted the focus from outbound sales to inbound customer acquisition. Embracing this shift needs:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>User-centricity</strong>: Re-aligning every department in the organization to focus on the user</li>



<li><strong>Product virality</strong>: Building the product to meet customer needs so they begin a flywheel of referrals and adoption</li>



<li><strong>Data intelligence</strong>: Gathering and extracting value from direct, indirect, and third-party data to inform product-related decisions</li>



<li><strong>Automation</strong>: Enabling the product to drive adoption with automation and AI</li>



<li><strong>Value orientation</strong>: Creating experiences that deliver value immediately and consistently</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="31-level-up-your-product-led-growth-strategy-with-clickup-"><strong>Level Up Your Product-Led Growth Strategy with ClickUp</strong></h2>



<p>The product-led growth model is a go-to-market strategy that rests on the strong foundations of a robust product. <strong>In PLG, the product itself acts as a marketing, sales, and customer success engine, supported by external promotions</strong>.</p>



<p>Slackbot’s self-service onboarding, Zoom’s free version, and Hubspot’s educational content have shown us that product-led growth works. In fact, it could be the only way going forward as the market and user behavior evolves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To mount a strong go-to-market strategy, you need a comprehensive suite of <a href="https://clickup.com/blog/product-led-growth-software-tools/">product-led growth software tools</a>. ClickUp is exactly that. Its end-to-end project management and automation capabilities will support every aspect of PLG through scale. What’s more?

<p>Let’s dive into it!&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="0-what-is-a-workflow-diagram-"><strong>What is a workflow diagram?</strong></h2>



<p>You might have heard of them referred to as <a href="/blog?p=49965">process diagrams</a> or even business <a href="/blog?p=49653">process mapping</a>. Regardless, the underlying idea is the same.</p>



<p>Workflow diagrams are designed to be visual roadmaps of a process. They’re usually created to help teams outline and improve their work processes. For example, an HR team might need to create a workflow diagram to <a href="/blog?p=28435">refine their new employee onboarding strategy</a>; while the <a href="/blog?p=53209">IT management department</a> might use a workflow diagram to improve their vendor vetting process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The concept of a workflow diagram was created in the late 1800s by <a href="https://www.bl.uk/people/henry-laurence-gantt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Henry Gantt</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Winslow_Taylor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Frederick Winslow Taylor. </a>The reason? Long before <a href="/blog?p=67899">diagram software</a> was a thing, industrial businesses were using management science to tame efficiency and make sure that the quality of their output was high. How? They created process diagrams.</p>



<p>The beauty of process diagrams is that they not only outline the tasks that make up a process (like a to-do list with a beginning and an end), but they can also <a href="/blog?p=74354">help you visualize</a> data, decision-making journeys, and even <a href="/blog?p=12236">key milestones in any given process</a>. Awesome, right? And visualization is just one of many benefits.</p>

<p>Now, part of embracing workflow diagrams is getting familiar with all the benefits they offer. In essence, they’re all about driving improvement.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-improve-team-communication-"><strong>Improve team communication</strong></h3>



<p>If there’s one thing teams need to do, it’s to be on the same page. They also need as much clarity as they can get.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Workflow diagrams are a perfect way for <a href="/blog?p=5096">teams to collaborate</a> on visualizing the systems that will help them ship their project to the finish line. This makes for faster processes and much less wasted resources.&nbsp; It also helps alleviate irritating bottlenecks. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/231b.png" alt="⌛" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>Picture a swimming lane in a pool. Then picture an outline with tasks, as well as tagging the team members responsible for those tasks, in a vertical setup. That’s what you call a <a href="/blog?p=61490">swimlane diagram</a>.</p>



<p>It’s a useful workflow diagram when you’re trying to find where tasks conflict with each other. And it’s also a solid way to keep team members accountable and establish ownership of key tasks in any given process.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="7-2-timeline-diagram-"><strong>2. Timeline diagram</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-create-block-cu-image-with-overlay"><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><div class="cu-image-with-overlay__overlay"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/image7-1.png" alt="Timeline diagram" class="image skip-lazy cu-image-with-overlay__image" style="width:100%;height:auto"/><div class="cu-image-with-overlay__cta-wrap"><a href="https://clickup.com/features/whiteboards" class="cu-image-with-overlay__cta cu-image-with-overlay__cta--#7c68ee" data-segment-track-click="true" data-segment-section-model-name="imageCTA" data-segment-button-clicked="Discover ClickUp Whiteboard" data-segment-props="{&quot;location&quot;:&quot;body&quot;,&quot;sectionModelName&quot;:&quot;imageCTA&quot;,&quot;buttonClicked&quot;:&quot;Discover ClickUp Whiteboard&quot;}" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discover ClickUp Whiteboard</a></div></div></figure></div></div>



<p>This diagram is exactly as it sounds: it maps out a visual of a sequence of events in order. Timeline diagrams help you take in a more accurate overview of the scope of a process.</p>



<p>It can help you figure out where your time is going as well as where you’re wasting the most time. Processes that consume a lot of resources, including time, can benefit from using a timeline diagram. Project managers and warehouse operations directors can find this diagram useful.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can use the process workflow diagram to illustrate the relationship between the tasks that make up a process. It’s great to standardize a process you use often.

<p>The process workflow diagram is straightforward, which makes it the perfect diagram to <a href="/blog?p=68482">drive decision-making</a> and improve on an already established system.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="10-5-data-workflow-diagram-"><strong>5. Data workflow diagram</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-create-block-cu-image-with-overlay"><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><div class="cu-image-with-overlay__overlay"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/image3-2.png" alt="Data workflow diagram" class="image skip-lazy cu-image-with-overlay__image" style="width:100%;height:auto"/><div class="cu-image-with-overlay__cta-wrap"><a href="https://clickup.com/features/whiteboards" class="cu-image-with-overlay__cta cu-image-with-overlay__cta--#7c68ee" data-segment-track-click="true" data-segment-section-model-name="imageCTA" data-segment-button-clicked="Discover ClickUp Whiteboard" data-segment-props="{&quot;location&quot;:&quot;body&quot;,&quot;sectionModelName&quot;:&quot;imageCTA&quot;,&quot;buttonClicked&quot;:&quot;Discover ClickUp Whiteboard&quot;}" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discover ClickUp Whiteboard</a></div></div></figure></div></div>



<p>A data workflow diagram works best when you’re trying to visualize the flow of data in a process instead of just listing the tasks needed to complete it from beginning to end.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Where is the data coming from? Where will it go when a specific task is completed? How does a data point conflict with a decision-making point? These are all questions you’ll have an easier time answering once you’ve mapped out a data diagram.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Data diagrams are also great for outlining how data flows within teams and if there’ll be conflicting data processing with adjacent teams. It’s a great way to map out a system you’re already using so that you can make it more efficient.&nbsp;</p>

<p id="8-how-to-create-your-first-workflow-diagram-">While you can use the traditional analog method of good old pen and paper to create your workflow diagrams, here’s some advice: skip that. It’s way better to use a digital tool to create your diagrams.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They’re shareable, easily editable, and you can store them on your laptop ‘til the end of time. <a href="https://clickup.com/features/whiteboards">ClickUp’s Whiteboard feature</a> gives you a canva on which you can easily get started creating and sharing your workflow diagrams.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="12-1-get-familiar-with-workflow-diagrams-amp-charts-symbols-"><strong>1. Get familiar with Workflow Diagrams &amp; Charts symbols</strong></h3>



<p>&nbsp;There’s a rhyme and reason to workflow diagrams. In other words, they’re built with standardized shapes that are assigned a meaning–so everyone that reads a workflow diagram is on the same page. Here’s a quick rundown:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Arrow/line:</strong> These are used to signify both the direction and the flow of your diagram. They’re also used as connector symbols that connect certain shapes/tasks. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/27a1.png" alt="➡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>



<li><strong>Parallelogram:</strong> You can use these to show exactly where new data enters a process. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f4d2.png" alt="📒" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>



<li><strong>Diamond:</strong> This shape is used to show a decision in your workflow that’s necessary to move to the next step. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f536.png" alt="🔶" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>



<li><strong>Rectangle:</strong> You can use a rectangle to symbolize a single step in a workflow diagram <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f7ea.png" alt="🟪" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>



<li><strong>Cylinder:</strong> Want to add data to your workflow? This is what a cylinder is for. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f50b.png" alt="🔋" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>



<li><strong>Oval:</strong> These mark the beginning and endpoints of a workflow. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f3c9.png" alt="🏉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>
</ul>



<p>Now that you’re familiar with workflow symbols, here’s how to choose the right diagram.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="13-2-choose-your-diagram-according-to-your-end-goal-"><strong>2. Choose your diagram according to your end goal</strong></h3>



<p>Choosing the right workflow diagram for you starts with the end goal in mind. For example, decide if you want to:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Visualize a new process for an upcoming project</li>



<li>Run a <a href="/blog?p=67200">workflow analysis</a> to identify inefficiencies in an old system</li>



<li>Optimize how you use all your resources throughout a process</li>



<li>Set team expectations for a specific workflow and improve how you communicate</li>



<li>Break down a highly complex process with a ton of different tasks, decision-making points, and data </li>
</ul>



<p>Then each task can be road-mapped with a different type of workflow. Let’s say you’re an architecture firm that needs to optimize the process of <a href="/blog?p=46081">onboarding new clients</a>. Creating a <a href="/blog?p=53596">process mapping diagram</a> (see our list above) might be in order.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, now you’ve chosen the workflow diagram that’ll work for you. But you can’t create one without the right tools at your disposal. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f6e0.png" alt="🛠" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="0-what-are-sales-okrs-"><strong>What Are Sales OKRs?</strong></h2>



<p>OKRs, or objectives and key results, are a goal-setting framework to align efforts with an organization&#8217;s strategy. </p>



<p>Sales OKRs apply the OKR framework to sales teams. Objectives in sales OKRs are qualitative goals aimed at motivating and guiding the sales team, while the key results are measurable metrics that track progress toward these objectives.</p>



<p>By integrating these elements, <a href="https://clickup.com/blog/how-to-track-okrs/">Sales OKRs track</a> daily sales activities to ensure they are aligned with strategic business goals and deliver results. In doing so, they enhance focus, accountability, and continuous improvement within the sales function.</p>



<p>Here are the key benefits that sales OKRs offer:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Builds goal-oriented focus:</strong> By zeroing in on a few critical objectives, Sales OKRs help sales and marketing teams prioritize their efforts and minimize distractions</li>



<li><strong>Helps quantify ambitious goals</strong>: Sales OKRs blend qualitative <a href="https://clickup.com/blog/sales-goals/">sales goals</a> with measurable outcomes. This allows sales teams to track progress on an organizational and operational level</li>



<li><strong>Strengthens accountability</strong>: Along with goal-setting, the approach involves the right stakeholders. This ensures transparency and holds individuals accountable for their contributions</li>



<li><strong>Promotes continuous improvement:</strong> Regularly reviewing OKRs helps identify what strategies and results fit better. By adapting these strategies, businesses ensure continuous improvement</li>
</ul>

<p>Tracking and measuring sales OKRs is crucial for achieving success and aligning your efforts with organizational goals. Without proper tracking, reaching your OKR targets can be daunting.</p>



<p>Here are some steps you can take to track and measure sales OKRs:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Set up regular check-ins:</strong> Schedule periodic reviews to assess progress and make necessary adjustments. This helps ensure that OKRs remain relevant and achievable</li>

<li><strong>Utilize data analytics:</strong> Utilize analytics tools to collect and analyze data related to your OKRs. This provides insights into performance trends and helps in making data-driven decisions</li>



<li><strong>Implement progress tracking tools:</strong> Use tools designed for tracking OKRs and sales performance. These tools can automate progress updates and provide real-time visibility</li>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="18-sales-okr-challenges-solutions-and-tips-"><strong>Sales OKR: Challenges, Solutions, and Tips</strong></h2>



<p>Sales OKRs are effective tools for driving growth and performance, but creating and implementing them can be challenging.</p>



<p>Here are four common challenges businesses face:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Creating alignment:</strong> Sales teams often struggle to align their OKRs with the broader business strategy, resulting in misaligned efforts and missed opportunities</li>



<li><strong>Ambitious or unrealistic OKRs:</strong> Setting overly ambitious OKRs within short time frames and limited resources can lead to frustration, demotivation, and potential failure</li>



<li><strong>Resistance to change: </strong>Transitioning from traditional methods to the OKR framework may encounter resistance due to a lack of understanding, sudden changes in task assignments, and shifting expectations</li>



<li><strong>Failure to revisit and adjust OKRs: </strong>OKRs must evolve with the business&#8217;s current status and market conditions. Neglecting to review and adjust OKRs regularly can render them outdated and irrelevant</li>
</ul>



<p>Here are some tips and solutions to overcome these challenges:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Conduct cross-functional meetings</strong>: Hold regular cross-functional meetings to ensure alignment and avoid duplication of efforts</li>



<li><strong>Plan incremental efforts:</strong> Break each OKR into manageable, incremental tasks. This approach provides a clear, achievable roadmap and helps prevent overwhelming the sales team with sudden workload and pressure</li>



<li><strong>Deploy training modules to improve competencies: </strong>Offer comprehensive training and support to help employees adopt OKRs. Implement the OKR methodology in phases and run test projects to ease the transition and build competencies gradually</li>



<li><strong>Align OKRs to existing processes:</strong> Review and adjust OKRs to fit your sales cycle and accounting processes. Ensure they align with quarterly revenue targets and other existing workflows</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="19-achieve-sales-okr-success-with-clickup-"><strong>Achieve Sales OKR Success with ClickUp</strong></h2>

<p>Think of a road trip to a new destination, but without a regular physical map or Google Maps—you’re bound to get lost. Frustrating, right? That’s what a website or app feels like to new users without a clear user flow.</p>



<p>A well-structured user flow is the backbone of a successful user experience (UX) design. It creates a smooth track for users, effortlessly guiding them from their initial interest (landing page) to the desired action (conversion).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Without it, users may face confusion and abandon carts or drop sign-ups, leading to missed opportunities and decreased conversion rates.</p>



<p>In this blog, we&#8217;ll explore user flow examples, learn how to create them, and discuss strategies and best practices to optimize your designs. </p>



<p>Let’s get started!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="0-what-is-a-user-flow-"><strong>What Is a User Flow?</strong></h2>



<p><strong>A user flow is a series of steps someone takes to complete a task on a website or app.</strong> It shows how users move from one page to another section to reach their intended destination. </p>



<p>The purpose of user flow diagrams is to visually outline all the steps that need to be followed clearly, from the initial interaction to the final action of the purchasing flow, like buying a product or signing up for a newsletter.</p>



<p>For example, a user flow might begin with a Google search, leading to a product page, followed by adding an item to the cart and ending with a successful checkout.</p>



<p>So, a well-designed user flow ensures a seamless, intuitive experience, <strong>minimizing friction and effortlessly guiding users</strong> toward conversion.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-types-of-user-flow-diagrams-"><strong>Types of user flow diagrams</strong></h3>



<p>User flow diagrams help understand how a user interacts with a product, identify potential pain points or areas for improvement, and optimize the user journey. They also help you validate and refine an app idea. These diagrams can take various forms, each suited to different needs:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Task flow diagrams</strong>: These diagrams focus on specific tasks, mapping out each step a user needs to take to complete a particular action, such as registering for an account or booking a service</li>



<li><strong>Wireflows</strong>: Wireflows blend wireframes with flow diagrams, illustrating how users interact with various screens throughout their journey by providing a detailed view of user interactions. This typically involves creating flows on mobile screens</li>



<li><strong>Flowchart diagrams</strong>: Traditional flowcharts use symbols like rectangles, diamonds, and arrows to map out decisions, actions, and the paths users take</li>



<li><strong>Sitemap diagrams</strong>: Sitemap diagrams outline the structure and hierarchy of a website, helping to organize content logically and show how users navigate between different pages</li>



<li><strong>Swimlane diagrams</strong>: These diagrams separate different user roles or systems into lanes, showing how each interacts within a process</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-importance-of-user-flow-in-user-experience-design-"><strong>Importance of user flow in user experience design</strong></h3>



<p>User flow is an essential part of <a href="https://clickup.com/blog/ux-strategy/">UX strategy</a> and design. It works as a blueprint for guiding users or customers, streamlining the user&#8217;s path, improving client satisfaction, and boosting engagement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Without clear user flows, customers may face confusion, frustration, and dead ends, leading to higher bounce rates and lost conversions.</p>



<p>Mapping well-designed user flows offers valuable insights that lead to smarter UX design decisions. Here are the <strong>benefits of mapping and tracking user flows:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Design with the user in mind</strong>: Creating user flows encourages you to think from the user&#8217;s perspective. By understanding their behavior, you can identify areas they find difficult or confusing and make design changes that better align with their needs and expectations</li>



<li><strong>Reduce user churn</strong>: When users have a seamless, positive experience with your product app or website, they are more likely to stay engaged and loyal. By improving the overall flow, you can decrease user churn and increase client retention</li>



<li><strong>Minimize friction in the user journey</strong>: Visualizing intuitive user flows helps you spot areas of friction or potential dead ends in the user experience. Addressing these issues leads to a smoother user journey for your users, which increases the chances of conversions<br></li>
</ul>

<p>This diagram outlines the steps Instagram users take to access their accounts or sign up for new ones. It starts with existing users entering their username and password or new users selecting the signup option.</p>



<p>New users then enter their email or phone number and go through a verification process, like receiving an OTP or email confirmation. After that, they can add a profile picture, sync contacts, and connect with Facebook to find friends.</p>



<p>The color scheme of this user flow diagram is basic: pink for main actions (login/signup), blue for extra steps (verification, syncing), and green for successful completions. This basic user flow example is simple and neat, making it easy for users to follow along and<strong> finish the registration process without confusion.</strong></p>

<p>The onboarding flow diagram is one of the most common user flow examples and presents a simple decision-based process. The main goal of this basic user flow chart is to <strong>guide users through key features efficiently,</strong> ensuring they understand the product before completing the onboarding process.</p>



<p>This user flow example uses black diamonds for decision points, green circles for ‘Yes’ actions, and red circles for ‘No’ actions. Here, yellow boxes represent key steps or tooltips.</p>



<p>The user flow begins with a welcome message, followed by the user&#8217;s choice to start onboarding. If they choose ‘Yes,’ the first feature is introduced via a tooltip. The user then has the option to click the ‘Next’ button. If they proceed, a second feature is introduced with another tooltip. If they choose ‘No’ at either decision point, the onboarding flow ends.</p>

<p>The review generation user flow diagram tracks the process of collecting user feedback through a Net Promoter Score (NPS) survey after the user has spent two weeks with the app. This is one of the popular user flow examples. Its goal is to <strong>gather user feedback and direct satisfied users (Promoters) to review the app on an external website,</strong> enhancing its reputation.</p>



<p>The diagram design uses black diamonds for decision points, yellow for survey prompts and actions, cyan for user engagement steps, and white for endpoints.</p>



<p>The NPS survey is the entry point of the user flow. The user can either engage with the survey or dismiss it. If the user chooses to engage, they fill out the NPS survey and, based on their feedback, are classified as Promoter, Passive, or Detractor.</p>

<p>The website user flow diagram outlines the steps a user takes, from landing on the homepage to completing various actions like login, registration, and purchasing via an app or website. The goal is to <strong>guide users through the primary functions of the website</strong> smoothly.</p>



<p>The minimalistic design of this purchasing flow uses a single color scheme of light blue and dark blue arrows to indicate flow direction. Rectangular boxes represent different actions and decisions.</p>



<p>The user flow starts with the user either logging in or registering. If the user forgets their password or requires two-step verification, additional steps must be followed. Once logged in, users can access the account page or initiate a purchase through a wire transfer, which involves three steps before completing the transaction.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="10-how-to-create-high-performing-user-flows-"><strong>How to Create High-Performing User Flows</strong></h2>



<p>To create user flow diagrams for your app development, follow these steps:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="11-step-1-understand-user-behavior-and-goals-"><strong>Step 1: Understand user behavior and goals</strong></h3>



<p>Before you begin the specific task of creating a good user flow, you must first understand your users&#8217; goals, such as what drives them to use your product and how they expect it to function.</p>



<p><a href="https://clickup.com/blog/how-to-conduct-user-research/">Conducting user research</a> and creating a customer journey map is crucial at this stage as both provide insights into what services you should offer and how your target audience will interact with them.</p>



<p>At this point, you must also <strong>create</strong> <strong>user personas</strong> to <strong>identify user behaviors</strong> and map actual users throughout various user activities on different paths on your site or app.</p>

</div>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="12-step-2-outline-an-effective-user-flow-"><strong>Step 2: Outline an effective user flow</strong></h3>



<p>Now, <strong>identify the multiple entry points</strong> (such as Google ads, social media, marketing emails, direct visitors, organic traffic, etc.) where users access your platform and reach the login screen. Understanding how users enter your site or app will enable you to design user flows that enhance the overall experience.</p>



<p>After identifying the different entry points,<strong> outline the user path and possible actions</strong> people take to reach their final destination.</p>



<p>Don&#8217;t forget to <strong>determine what happens once users reach the final stage</strong>. This could be a thank-you screen for subscribing or placing an order, or a redirection to a specific page, such as the home screen.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="13-step-3-visualize-your-user-flow-diagrams-"><strong>Step 3: Visualize your user flow diagrams</strong></h3>



<p>Once you&#8217;ve outlined the user flows, it&#8217;s time to visualize them. There are several <a href="https://clickup.com/blog/flowchart-software/">flowchart software</a> that can assist in this process.</p>



<p>Certain <strong>standard shapes are used to visualize the user flow diagram</strong> examples. They represent different elements or user behaviors in a user flow diagram, such as:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Ovals</strong> for entry points and final stages</li>



<li><strong>Rectangles</strong> for pages or screens</li>



<li><strong>Arrows</strong> to connect steps in a user&#8217;s typical journey</li>



<li><strong>Parallelograms</strong> for input/output actions of the UX flow diagram</li>



<li><strong>Diamonds</strong> for decision points</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="14-step-4-develop-a-user-centered-design-prototype-"><strong>Step 4: Develop a user-centered design prototype</strong></h3>



<p>Once you&#8217;ve developed user flow diagrams, the next step is to <strong><a href="https://clickup.com/blog/wireframe-templates/">create UI wireframes</a> or mockups.</strong> This transition lets you visualize how content and user interactions will come together on the screen. It enables you to further enhance the overall UX by<strong> adding visual elements and refining details</strong>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="15-step-5-assess-the-user-flow-charts-and-improvise-as-needed-"><strong>Step 5: Assess the user flow charts and improvise as needed</strong></h3>



<p>The final step is to <strong>validate your design through user testing,</strong> which can be done in many ways, including <a href="https://clickup.com/blog/usability-testing-examples/">usability testing</a>. Share your prototype with stakeholders and end-users to gather feedback on how well the UI aligns with user expectations. By analyzing user behavior and feedback, you can <strong>identify areas for improvement</strong> within your UX design process.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="0-what-is-a-product-team-structure">What Is a Product Team Structure?</h2>



<p><strong>A product </strong><a href="/blog?p=142106"><strong>team structure</strong></a><strong> defines how a team is organized to develop, manage, and deliver a successful product. </strong>It describes the composition of the group responsible for a specific product. The structure ensures the team operates efficiently, communicates effectively, and aligns with the overall business strategy and goals.</p>



<p>A product team structure outlines roles like product managers, designers, engineers, and potentially other specialists, such as data analysts or marketers. This structure determines how these individuals interact, make decisions, and contribute to the product&#8217;s development.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-the-importance-of-a-structured-product-team">The importance of a structured product team</h3>



<p>A well-defined product team structure is essential for several reasons:</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-1-clear-roles-and-responsibilities">1. Clear roles and responsibilities</h4>



<p>Everyone knows their job and how their work contributes to the overall product. This clarity prevents duties overlap, reduces confusion, and covers all necessary tasks.</p>



<p>Example: In a tech company, having distinct roles for product managers, engineers, and designers ensures that specialists simplify product management, leading to a higher-quality product.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-2-improved-communication">2. Improved communication</h4>



<p>A well-defined structure facilitates the flow of information, ideas, and feedback, which is critical for timely decision-making and problem-solving.</p>



<p>Example: In a retail company, the marketing team can effectively communicate product positioning strategies to the design and development teams, ensuring the final product aligns with market needs.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-3-faster-decision-making">3. Faster decision-making</h4>



<p>When the structure is clear, decision-making becomes quicker and more efficient.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Example: In a startup, the Chief Product Officer can quickly prioritize features or pivot the <a href="/blog?p=13712">product management strategy</a> without waiting for prolonged discussions, helping the company stay agile in a competitive market.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-4-increased-efficiency">4. Increased efficiency</h4>



<p>With clear roles and a streamlined workflow, the team can work more efficiently, reducing redundancies and ensuring that resources are used effectively.</p>



<p>Example: In a manufacturing company, a well-structured product team can quickly iterate on prototypes, ensuring that the final product meets quality standards and is delivered on time.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="6-5-enhanced-innovation-and-creativity">5. Enhanced innovation and creativity</h4>



<p>When team members are clear on their roles and responsibilities, they can focus on innovation within their domain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Example: In a tech startup, designers can experiment with new UX/UI designs without worrying about other operational aspects of the product, leading to more innovative user experiences.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="7-6-better-risk-management">6. Better risk management</h4>



<p>Each team member or role can focus on specific aspects of risk, such as technical challenges, market risks, or customer feedback, leading to a more robust product.</p>



<p>Example: In a software development company, the engineering team can focus on technical risks while the marketing team handles market adoption risks, ensuring comprehensive risk management.</p>

</div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="8-key-positions-in-the-product-team-">Key Positions in the Product Team&nbsp;</h2>



<p>A well-balanced product development team requires diverse skills and perspectives. Let&#8217;s break down some of the key roles and their responsibilities.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="9-product-manager">Product manager</h3>



<p><span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">The <a href="/blog?p=127601" target="_blank" rel="noopener">product manager</a>’s job is <strong>to understand the market, define the product, and ensure it meets customer needs and business objectives.</strong></span> They work closely with other product teams, group customers, and team members to bring the product to life, from concept to launch.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="10-product-developer">Product developer</h3>



<p>Product developers are the <strong>technical brains of the operation</strong>. They&#8217;re responsible for building and maintaining the product, including writing code, testing, and debugging. They collaborate with the product manager to translate product requirements into technical specifications and code.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="11-data-analyst">Data analyst</h3>



<p>Data analysts are the detectives of the product team. They <strong>uncover insights from data</strong> to inform product decisions. They analyze user behavior, market trends, and product performance to identify opportunities and challenges. Their work helps product leaders make data-driven decisions and improves product performance.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="12-qa-engineer">QA engineer</h3>



<p>QA engineers <strong>ensure the product works as expected</strong> and meets quality standards. They also test the product for bugs, errors, and usability issues. Their goal is to deliver a flawless product experience to customers.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="13-product-marketer">Product marketer</h3>



<p>Product marketers <strong>develop and execute strategies to promote the product </strong>and generate demand. They formulate the go-to-market strategy (based on user research and market research), create compelling messaging, build brand awareness, and drive sales. They work closely with the product manager to understand the product&#8217;s value proposition and target audience.</p>


<div class="wp-block-ub-styled-box ub-styled-box ub-notification-box" id="ub-styled-box-62a798cd-2ac1-4a56-9771-4f33fddc3d68">

</div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="14-common-product-team-structures">Common Product Team Structures</h2>



<p>Understanding common product team structures can help optimize collaboration and drive successful product development.</p>



<p>Let’s discuss a few common product team structures:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="15-structure-by-product-or-features">Structure by product or features</h3>



<p>This structure is <strong>typical in companies with multiple products or product lines. </strong>Each product or feature set has its dedicated team. This approach can be effective for focusing on specific product needs but might lead to silos if not managed carefully.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Companies like Adobe and Microsoft often organize their product teams around different product lines. In such cases, the product manager typically reports to the head of that particular product line.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="16-structure-by-cross-functional-teams">Structure by cross-functional teams</h3>



<p>Cross-functional teams bring together individuals from various departments, such as design, engineering, marketing, and sales. This structure promotes collaboration and accelerates product development.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, managing different skill sets and priorities can be challenging. Reporting is usually done in a <a href="https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/matrix-organization-structure-reason-evolution-1837" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">matrix structure</a>, where different teams report to multiple leaders. Companies like Amazon and Spotify have successfully implemented cross-functional teams.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="17-structure-by-customer-journey-stages">Structure by customer journey stages</h3>



<p>This approach to product team structure organizes teams based on different stages of the customer journey. This means there will be a team specifically for customer acquisition, another for customer onboarding, and another for retention. It helps focus on specific customer needs and improves the overall customer experience. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="18-structure-by-performance-metrics">Structure by performance metrics</h3>



<p>Product management teams can also be formed based on specific key performance indicators (KPIs) or goals. Each product team in the organization focuses on its KPIs, which are set by the product head.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Companies in the eCommerce industry often use this structure to optimize key performance indicators, such as customer acquisition cost, conversion rates, customer churn rate, customer lifetime value, etc. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="19-structure-by-product-managers%E2%80%99-skills">Structure by product managers’ skills</h3>



<p>This structure groups product managers based on expertise in a particular area, such as consumer products, enterprise software, or mobile applications. It allows for specialization but might limit cross-pollination of ideas. Companies with a diverse product portfolio usually follow this approach.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="20-structure-by-customer-segments">Structure by customer segments</h3>



<p>Teams are organized around specific customer segments or user personas. This structure encourages each team to immerse itself in its customer segment to understand its pains, frustrations, and implied needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, a large bank usually has different teams dedicated to serving high-net-worth individuals, small businesses, and retail customers. Each team would deeply understand the specific needs and preferences of the segment it addresses.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="30-importance-of-a-cross-functional-team-in-product-development">Importance of a Cross-Functional Team in Product Development</h2>



<p>Cross-functional teams are essential for modern product development. They bring together diverse expertise to create innovative, user-centric products.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="31-agile-software-development-and-the-product-team">Agile software development and the product team</h4>



<p>Agile software development methodology emphasizes iterative and incremental development, flexible planning, and customer collaboration.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead of following a rigid plan, <strong>Agile teams break down projects into smaller, manageable chunks called sprints.</strong> Each sprint of one to four weeks involves planning, designing, coding, testing, and delivering a working product increment.</p>



<p>The benefits of Agile include faster time to market, improved customer satisfaction, increased flexibility, and higher product quality. It also allows for quick decision-making, efficient problem-solving, and a shared sense of ownership over the product.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="32-scrum-in-a-cross-functional-team">Scrum in a cross-functional team</h4>



<p>Scrum is a popular Agile framework that thrives in cross-functional teams. This means the team members possess all the skills necessary to create incremental improvements to the product. It is less about individual expertise and more about the team&#8217;s collective ability to deliver.</p>



<p><strong>It manages complex projects, particularly in software development, by promoting iterative progress through sprint cycles.</strong> Scrum emphasizes teamwork, accountability, and continuous improvement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Being cross-functional allows the team to be self-sufficient and deliver fully functional increments at the end of each sprint.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="33-effects-of-user-experience-design-on-product-development">Effects of user experience design on product development</h4>



<p>User experience (UX) design plays a critical role in product development by <strong>focusing on creating products that are intuitive, enjoyable, and accessible for users. </strong>UX design ensures the product is built considering the end user&#8217;s needs and behaviors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The same cross-cultural collaboration leads to products with better usability, accessibility, overall user satisfaction, and higher adoption rates. Companies like Apple have prioritized UX design and have reaped the rewards of a solid cross-functional team.</p>



<p>In competitive markets, superior UX can differentiate a product from competitors, offering a distinct advantage by delivering a better user experience.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="34-analysis-of-successful-companies%E2%80%99-product-team-structures">Analysis of Successful Companies’ Product Team Structures</h2>



<p>Now that we understand the benefits of product teams and their components, let’s analyze the structures of successful product teams:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="35-1-spotify">1. Spotify</h3>



<p><a href="https://engineering.atspotify.com/2014/03/spotify-engineering-culture-part-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Spotify has become synonymous</a> with <strong>Agile product development and strongly emphasizes user experience</strong>. Its product team structure is an excellent example of how cross-functional teams can drive innovation and success.</p>



<p>Spotify has a high-alignment, high-autonomy work culture, as shown in the image below.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="828" height="550" src="https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-561.png" alt="Spotify Team Structure" class="wp-image-206006" srcset="https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-561.png 828w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-561-300x199.png 300w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-561-768x510.png 768w, https://clickup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-561-700x465.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 828px) 100vw, 828px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">via <a href="https://engineering.atspotify.com/2014/03/spotify-engineering-culture-part-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Spotify</a></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Key characteristics of Spotify&#8217;s product team structure</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Squad-based organization:</strong> Spotify operates using small, self-contained teams called squads. Each squad is cross-functional and comprises engineers, designers, product managers, and data analysts. This structure promotes autonomy and rapid decision making</li>



<li><strong>Data-driven culture:</strong> Spotify extensively uses data to inform product decisions. Data analysts work closely with product teams to understand user behavior and preferences</li>



<li><strong>Product owner empowerment:</strong> Spotify&#8217;s product owners have significant autonomy in defining the company&#8217;s product vision and roadmap. This empowers them to make quick decisions and respond to market changes</li>

<p>Spotify&#8217;s success highlights the importance of empowering teams and providing them with the necessary resources.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="36-2-amazon">2. Amazon</h3>



<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/executive-insights/content/product-management-at-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Amazon&#8217;s product team</a> structure is characterized by a high degree of ownership, autonomy, and a relentless focus on the customer. The company&#8217;s culture is built around &#8220;ownership,&#8221; where teams are empowered to make decisions and drive results.</p>



<p>Key characteristics of Amazon&#8217;s product team structure:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Two-pizza teams:</strong> Amazon is famous for its ‘two-pizza’ rule, suggesting that teams should be small enough to be fed by two pizzas, typically smaller teams with not more than six members. This promotes close collaboration, faster decision-making, and increased agility</li>



<li><strong>Customer obsession:</strong> Amazon&#8217;s product teams are deeply customer-centric. They focus on understanding and meeting customer needs rather than simply building features</li>



<li><strong>Single-threaded owners:</strong> The product managers have complete ownership and accountability over their products and services and have no other distractions. This instills a strong sense of responsibility and accountability</li>



<li><strong>Data-driven decision-making:</strong> Amazon relies heavily on data to inform product decisions. Teams use data to measure performance, identify opportunities, and optimize products</li>
</ul>



<p>Amazon&#8217;s product team structure is intensely focused on customer obsession. Small teams promote close collaboration and rapid decision-making. The company&#8217;s success demonstrates the importance of cross-functional teams that strengthen teams to take risks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="37-3-buffer">3. Buffer</h3>



<p><a href="https://buffer.com/open" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Buffer, a social media management platform</a>, is known for its open and transparent culture. This philosophy is reflected in its product team structure, which emphasizes collaboration and customer feedback.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The company utilizes a <a href="https://buffer.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">hybrid model</a> combining cross-functional teams and product-focused teams. This structure allows for both specialization and a holistic view of the product.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Key characteristics of Buffer&#8217;s product team structure:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Cross-functional squads:</strong> Buffer utilizes cross-functional squad-structured product teams, similar to Spotify, consisting of engineers, designers, product managers, and customer development experts. This structure encourages collaboration and a holistic view of the product</li>



<li><strong>Distributed decision-making:</strong> Decision-making is often distributed among team members, promoting autonomy and ownership</li>



<li><strong>Customer-centric focus:</strong> Buffer ensures a deep understanding of user needs by integrating customer research and development into product teams</li>



<li><strong>Iterative development:</strong> Buffer follows an iterative approach to product development, allowing for rapid growth and adaptation. By empowering teams and promoting collaboration, Buffer has built a successful product that resonates with its target audience</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="38-performance-indicators-gauge-of-a-successful-product-team">Performance Indicators: Gauge of a Successful Product Team</h2>



<p><strong>Performance indicators provide measurable insights into how well the product management team achieves its goals, ensuring that the product development process is aligned with business objectives.</strong></p>



<p>They include metrics such as customer satisfaction, time-to-market, and feature adoption rates. Performance indicators are essential because they offer a clear, objective way to monitor progress and identify areas for improvement.</p>



<p><strong>Incorporating relevant performance indicators</strong> into your product team’s workflow is critical for success.</p>



<p>For instance, tracking <strong>Customer Satisfaction Scores (CSAT)</strong> can reveal how well the product meets user needs, while <strong>Cycle Time</strong> measures how quickly the team can deliver new features. These indicators help the team focus on providing value and meeting user expectations.</p>



<p>Performance indicators (PI) can be categorized into various types:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Product-centric PIs:</strong> Focuses on product usage, customer satisfaction, and market penetration (e.g., user acquisition, retention, churn rate, customer lifetime value, net promoter score)</li>



<li><strong>Team-centric PIs:</strong> Measures team efficiency and productivity (e.g., velocity, cycle time, bug rate, code quality)</li>



<li><strong>Business-centric PIs:</strong> Aligns with overall business objectives (e.g., revenue, profit margin, market share)</li>
</ul>



<p>By tracking a combination of these PIs, product teams can gain a comprehensive view of their performance.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="39-importance-of-data-analysis-in-product-development">Importance of data analysis in product development</h3>



<p>Data analysis is a vital part of product development. <strong>It informs strategic decisions by providing insights into user behavior, market trends, and performance metrics.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>By analyzing data, teams can make informed decisions, such as which features to prioritize or where to allocate resources. This ultimately leads to <strong>better product outcomes and a more effective product development process.</strong></p>



<p>For example, analyzing user behavior data can help identify product features that resonate with customers, while analyzing team velocity data can help optimize development processes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Data-driven insights enable product teams to make informed decisions about the product roadmap, resource allocation, and overall product strategy. Companies like <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/optimizing-the-netflix-streaming-experience-with-data-science-725f04c3e834" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Netflix</a> have leveraged data analytics extensively to drive further product innovation and customer success.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="40-how-to-determine-the-best-organizational-structure-for-your-product-team">How to Determine the Best Organizational Structure for Your Product Team</h2>



<p>Identifying the optimal product team structure is a complex task that requires careful consideration of your company’s unique goals, products, and resources. There&#8217;s no one-size-fits-all solution.</p>



<p>You can build a <a href="/blog?p=153961">high-performing team</a> by understanding the core roles within a product unit, exploring standard structural models, and leveraging performance indicators.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="0-what-is-objection-handling-"><strong>What is Objection Handling?&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Objection handling is when a sales rep addresses a prospect&#8217;s concerns. Specifically, it involves resolving a prospective customer&#8217;s doubts or hesitations about a product or service.</p>



<p>This involves actively listening to the prospect&#8217;s concerns—whether about high costs, product fitment, or comparison with competitors. You need to provide thoughtful responses that ease their concerns. </p>



<p>For example, if a prospect questions the cost of your product, you could explain how it provides long-term savings compared to cheaper alternatives.</p>



<p>Successfully managing such objections not only helps you turn them into opportunities but also advances you toward closing the deal.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-why-is-sales-objection-handling-important-"><strong>Why is Sales Objection Handling Important?&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Objection handling is essential in sales as it allows sales reps to effectively address critical customer objections, move customers forward in the sales cycle, and improve their chances of closing deals.<strong> </strong>It&#8217;s your chance to clear up doubts and show why your product or service is the right fit.<strong> </strong><br>Additionally, effective objection handling:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Clarifies value proposition: </strong>It helps the prospects understand the unique benefits of your product or service. It shows how your offering meets their needs better than competitors</li>



<li><strong>Establishes customer trust:</strong> It shows that the sales rep is willing to listen and understand their concerns. This builds trust and credibility</li>



<li><strong>Builds strong relationships: </strong>It shows the prospects that their concerns and satisfaction matter. It makes them feel heard and valued, which creates strong customer relationships and a loyal customer base</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-the-fff-technique-of-objection-handling-"><strong>The FFF Technique of Objection Handling</strong></h2>



<p>Leading with empathy is imperative for a successful sales effort. Therefore, one of the best methods for handling objections in sales and customer service is the FFF technique, which stands for:</p>



<p><strong>Feel </strong><br>The first F is all about being <strong>understanding and empathetic</strong>. As a sales professional, you must listen to your prospects and acknowledge their feelings and concerns. Let them know you understand how they feel. This helps your prospects feel heard and builds a good rapport. </p>



<p>For instance, if a prospect expresses worry about the implementation time of your product, say, &#8220;<strong><em>I understand that the timeline is a critical factor for you.&#8221;</em></strong></p>



<p><strong>Felt</strong><br>The second F refers to creating a feeling of relatability. Share a specific experience from your past or a story about another customer with similar concerns. This helps your prospects see that others have had this concern before and makes them feel like they&#8217;re not alone. </p>



<p>For instance, <strong><em>&#8220;Some of our customers initially worried about the time required for implementation but found that it was well worth it due to the immediate benefits they experienced.&#8221;</em></strong></p>



<p><strong>Found</strong><br>The third F provides evidence of your product. Share how other customers in similar situations have benefited from your product. Talking about positive outcomes will help ease your customers&#8217; concerns and move them further along in the sales process.</p>



<p>For example, &#8220;<em><strong>After implementing our solution, Company X saw a 30% increase in productivity within the first quarter.&#8221;</strong></em></p>



<p>Using the FFF technique transforms objections into valuable interactions, helping you build trust and improve customer satisfaction. This approach ultimately leads to more successful sales efforts. </p>


<div class="wp-block-ub-styled-box ub-styled-box ub-notification-box" id="ub-styled-box-71f4b716-34a1-4044-94bd-b1a81e6fb7b4">


<p id="ub-styled-box-notification-content-"><strong>Pro Tip <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f4a1.png" alt="💡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></strong>: Role-play different objection scenarios with your team to practice using the FFF technique. This can help build confidence and refine your approach in real sales situations.</p>


</div>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-application-of-the-fff-technique-in-customer-service-"><strong>Application of the FFF technique in customer service</strong></h3>



<p>The FFF technique is integral in many fields, including customer service. It helps you address issues like service delays, quality, product features, and other common product-related issues.</p>



<p>By answering with such objections, you validate your customers&#8217; feelings and move them toward realistic resolutions. In doing so, you turn negative experiences into positive interactions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a result, the FFF technique enables you to develop better relationships with your customers.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-the-steps-of-objection-handling-"><strong>The Steps of Objection Handling</strong></h2>



<p>After establishing a foundation of empathy with FFF, you can smoothly transition into the structured steps of objection handling:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-the-4-step-process-of-handling-objections-"><strong>The 4-step process of handling objections</strong></h3>



<p>This objection handling technique goes famously by the acronym LAER, which stands for:</p>



<p><strong>Listen</strong><br>When your prospect raises an objection, listen actively to what they say. This step shows that you are interested in and care about your prospect&#8217;s objection. </p>



<p>For example, if a prospect says your product is too complex, listen carefully and reflect on their concern by saying, <strong><em>&#8220;I hear that you find our product complex.&#8221;</em></strong></p>



<p><strong>Acknowledge</strong><br>Once your prospect explains their concern, acknowledge the objection by repeating it to show you are on the same page. This step helps to clarify the objection and makes the prospect feel heard and understood. </p>



<p>For instance, <strong><em>&#8220;It sounds like you&#8217;re concerned about the learning curve involved.&#8221;</em></strong></p>



<p><strong>Explore</strong><br>After acknowledging, dig deeper into their concern. Ask open-ended questions starting with words like &#8216;what else,&#8217; &#8216;why,&#8217; etc. This step helps you get to the root cause of the objection. </p>



<p>For example, <strong><em>&#8220;What specific aspects of the product seem complex or intimidating to you?&#8221;</em></strong></p>



<p><strong>Respond</strong><br>The final step is to choose the best way to respond. This may involve offering a tailored solution, recommending an alternative product or service, or sharing relevant testimonials. Once you&#8217;ve addressed the concern, check if the prospect is satisfied with the outcome. If not, investigate further and suggest the next best option. </p>



<p>For example, <strong><em>&#8220;We offer a comprehensive training program to help ease the learning curve. Would you like more details about that?&#8221;</em></strong></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="6-the-four-ps-of-handling-objection-"><strong><strong>The four P&#8217;s of handling objection</strong></strong></h3>



<p>To complement these steps, the four P&#8217;s offer additional strategies for confidently managing objections. They are:</p>



<p><strong>Pause</strong>: Do not interrupt your prospective customer<strong> </strong>when an objection arises during a sales call. This shows respect and your willingness to understand the objection. For example, if a prospect interrupts with a question or concern, pause and give them the space to express their concern completely.</p>



<p><strong>Probe</strong>: Ask questions to gain deeper insight into your customer&#8217;s concern. This enables you to move beyond the surface objection and uncover the real issue. For instance,<em> <strong>&#8220;What are your main worries about the implementation process?&#8221;</strong></em></p>



<p><strong>Provide</strong>: Based on the specific nature of the objection, develop a thoughtful and considerate response to address the issue. Say it to your customer in a calm and respectful tone. For example, <strong><em>&#8220;I understand your concern about integration. But we have several case studies to show how our product seamlessly integrates with your current systems.&#8221;</em></strong></p>



<p><strong>Prove</strong>: Support your response with evidence, such as statistical data, case studies, and customer testimonials. This validates your response and reassures your customer of your solution&#8217;s credibility. The fourth P encourages your customer to proceed and complete the buying process. For example, <strong><em>&#8220;Here&#8217;s a case study showing how our product helped Company Y save 20% annually.&#8221;</em></strong></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="7-the-three-step-strategy-in-objection-handling-"><strong>The three-step strategy in objection handling</strong></h3>



<p>Building on these techniques, the three-step strategy provides a streamlined objection handling process to move prospects toward a positive decision.</p>



<p><strong>Expect</strong>: Anticipate the most common sales objections and treat them as opportunities to know your prospects better. For example, if prospects have previously expressed concern about their budget, anticipate sales objections such as, <strong><em>&#8220;Our budget is too tight for this purchase.&#8221; </em></strong>Use this objection as a chance to explore their budget constraints and value expectations.</p>



<p><strong>Prepare</strong>: List potential objections and your responses before meeting the client. Create a document with common objections and how to address them. This will help you come up with answers for a wide range of objections, including budget-related concerns.</p>



<p><strong>Resolve:</strong> Ask questions to get to the core of the objection. Use your prepared answers as a guide to craft a tailored response that effectively addresses the concern. <br><br>Here’s an example of a tailored response:</p>



<div class="wp-block-clickup-clickup-author-quote cu-author-quote undefined"><blockquote class="cu-author-quote__quote"><p>Based on what you’ve shared, I understand that the product price and budget are major concerns. Many of our clients expressed similar concerns initially but found that the investment paid off through improved efficiency and reduced operational costs. One client even reported a 20% increase in productivity within the first quarter, which ultimately led to substantial cost savings.</p><p>To help with budgeting, we offer flexible pricing options that might suit your needs. Would you like more information about them?</p></blockquote></div>



<p>Deliver this response to resolve the objection and make the prospect feel optimistic about the purchase. </p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="9-effective-best-practices-for-objection-handling-"><strong>Effective best practices for objection handling</strong></h3>



<p>After exploring <a href="/blog?p=71284">sales enablement tools</a> and templates, let&#8217;s go through a few best practices for objection handling, such as:</p>



<p><strong>Anticipating sales objections: </strong>When you go into a sales call expecting objections, you feel more prepared to deal with them. Thus, it is a good idea to be aware of the common sales objections and ways to resolve them before starting a sales conversation with a prospect.</p>



<p><strong>Asking follow-up questions: </strong>Whenever you feel stuck after an objection, asking follow-up questions is good practice. This keeps the conversation rolling and gives you the information and time you need to turn the sale around.</p>



<p><strong>Leveraging social proof: </strong>Social proof validates your solution and assures the customer of the effectiveness of your product/service. Share testimonials or stories of customers who have had similar objections as the prospect and have benefited from your offerings.</p>



<p><strong>Setting specific dates and times: </strong>When your prospects need more time to deliberate, give them the space to weigh their options. However, stay in touch and set up specific dates and times to follow up to keep the sales process moving.</p>



<p><strong>Using a customer survey: </strong>Customer surveys help you determine how well your solution meets customer needs. Use tools like <a href="https://clickup.com/templates/customer-satisfaction-survey-t-182148152">ClickUp&#8217;s Customer Satisfaction Survey Template</a> to gather feedback on customer satisfaction with your products and services. Analyze this feedback to gain insights into <a href="/blog?p=174226">improving the customer-centricity</a> of your offerings and handling objections better in future sales interactions.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="10-common-types-of-sales-objections-and-ways-to-handle-them-"><strong>Common Types of Sales Objections and Ways to Handle Them</strong></h2>



<p>Most sales objections fall into four broad categories. Let&#8217;s examine each type and explore how sales reps can handle it.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="11-1-lack-of-trust-"><strong>1. Lack of trust</strong></h3>



<p>This sales objection arises when prospects have never heard of your company. Establishing trust in such a scenario can be difficult and may take time.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s essential to prepare a compelling sales pitch that delves into the value of your products/services, emphasizes your company&#8217;s strength in the market, provides case studies and customer testimonials, and delivers it with conviction.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="12-2-lack-of-need-"><strong>2. Lack of need</strong></h3>



<p>This sales objection arises when prospects don&#8217;t know how your product or service fits their current situation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Turn this objection into an opportunity by delving deep into their current challenges and uncovering any underlying needs. If there&#8217;s a fit, clearly show how your product addresses these specific issues and highlight its unique value.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="13-3-lack-of-urgency-"><strong>3. Lack of urgency</strong></h3>



<p>This sales objection arises when prospects feel that your product/service is not a priority to them right now. Assess whether this is due to a genuine timing issue or a reluctance to engage. Ask probing questions and listen carefully to your prospects&#8217; responses. If the current timing is the issue, schedule a follow-up conversation with them later to revisit the opportunity.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="14-4-lack-of-budget-"><strong>4. Lack of budget</strong></h3>



<p>This sales objection arises when the prospects find your product too expensive. Address this by highlighting the return on investment (ROI) and the long-term benefits of your offering. Show how your product&#8217;s value and savings can outweigh the initial expense.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="15-common-sales-objection-examples-and-techniques-to-respond-"><strong>Common Sales Objection Examples and Techniques to Respond&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Let&#8217;s understand some common sales objections and explore techniques for overcoming them.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="16-concerns-about-the-competition-"><strong>Concerns about the competition</strong></h3>



<p>When prospects are using a competitor&#8217;s product or service, they could have concerns such as:&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>I am already working with Competitor X</li>



<li>I am happy with Competitor Y</li>



<li>I am locked into a contract with Competitor Z</li>
</ul>



<p>To address these concerns, gauge their satisfaction with their current solution on a scale of 1 to 10. If their satisfaction level is less than 10, explore why. Identify any unmet needs of your prospects, demonstrate how your offering can uniquely fulfill those needs, and work towards increasing their satisfaction.</p>



<p><strong>Objections about price and budget</strong></p>



<p>These common objections involve scenarios where prospective customers say something like:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Your product is too expensive</li>



<li>We have exhausted our budget for this year</li>



<li>I need to use that budget for something else</li>
</ul>



<p>To address these objections, acknowledge your prospects&#8217; issues and discuss how your products can add value and benefit them in the long run.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="17-overcoming-objections-about-need-and-fit-"><strong>Overcoming objections about need and fit</strong></h3>



<p>When your prospects have objections about need and fit, they may say something like:&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>I need help with Z, not X</li>



<li>I doubt how your products could help me</li>



<li>Product Y is just a fad</li>
</ul>



<p>To handle these objections, ask clarifying questions to understand your prospects&#8217; needs and align your sales pitch accordingly to showcase the value of your products. Also, share customer data and testimonials to assure prospects that your products have been helpful and carry value over time. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="18-handling-sales-objections-about-authority-or-ability-to-buy-"><strong>Handling sales objections about authority or ability to buy</strong></h3>



<p>Objections about authority or ability to buy involve scenarios where prospects say something like:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>I don&#8217;t have authorization to sign off on this purchase</li>



<li>I can&#8217;t sell product X internally</li>



<li>I need to consult with other decision-makers</li>
</ul>



<p>To handle these objections, ask your prospects about the right person to speak to. Additionally, ask your prospects about the objections they anticipate and help them prepare a pitch they can deliver to their team or other decision-makers to sway the deal in your favor.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During a sales call, there is a high chance you may encounter some tough objection-handling challenges. Let&#8217;s understand what they are and how you can address them.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="20-dealing-with-a-hard-no-"><strong>Dealing with a hard &#8216;no&#8217;</strong></h3>



<p>When a prospect says &#8216;no,&#8217; figure out whether it&#8217;s a &#8216;not now&#8217; objection or a genuine, hard &#8216;no.&#8217; Ask clarifying questions to understand what no means.</p>



<p>If it&#8217;s a &#8216;not now&#8217; objection, schedule a follow-up with the prospect. However, if it&#8217;s a hard &#8216;no,&#8217; acknowledge and respect that prospect&#8217;s decision and move on to other prospects.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-ub-styled-box ub-styled-box ub-notification-box" id="ub-styled-box-718f6af3-7e0d-4ab8-8e57-8a12ecc44185">

<p>As a sales professional, it&#8217;s important to remind yourself that you cannot win everyone over. So, recognizing when to end a sales pitch or call can be challenging.</p>



<p>Despite your efforts, it&#8217;s time to move on if the prospect is blatantly disinterested or there&#8217;s a fundamental mismatch between the prospect&#8217;s need and your offerings. Gracefully end the conversation and move on to more promising opportunities. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="0-understanding-the-kano-model-"><strong>Understanding the Kano Model</strong></h2>



<p>The Kano Model, developed by Dr. Noriaki Kano in 1984, is a framework for categorizing and prioritizing product features based on their impact on customer satisfaction and <a href="/blog?p=131565">lifecycle management</a>.</p>



<p>Rooted in the idea that emotional responses drive customer satisfaction, the model helps assess which features meet basic expectations, which enhance satisfaction, and which delight customers. Like <a href="/blog?p=154275">agile prioritization techniques</a>, this model aids in aligning features with customer needs to maximize satisfaction and loyalty.</p>



<p>This <a href="/blog?p=135712">product management framework</a> categorizes product features into the following five distinct types based on their impact on customer satisfaction:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Must-have features: </strong>Also known as must-be features, these attributes are crucial for market acceptance, and their absence results in dissatisfaction. For example, functional seatbelts in cars are a fundamental safety requirement that customers expect, and a call function in smartphones is one of the basic features of a communication device</li>



<li><strong>Performance features: </strong>These features have a direct positive impact on satisfaction; the better the performance, the higher the customer satisfaction. For example, a larger gas tank in a vehicle extends the driving range between refueling, which enhances convenience. Similarly, extended battery life in electronics reduces the need for frequent charging, increasing usability and contributing to an overall improved user experience</li>



<li><strong>Indifferent features:</strong> Such features neither improve nor detract from customer satisfaction, regardless of their presence. Customers typically view them as irrelevant to their overall experience. For instance, the style of a product’s logo generally does not affect its functionality or user experience. Similarly, the number of ringtones available on the phone usually has little impact on its core appeal or performance for most users</li>



<li><strong>Attractive features: </strong>An attractive feature adds significant value and can drive impulse buys and repeat purchases. An example is an extra cover included with a new smartphone, which adds protection and style. Special promotional offers, such as discounts or complimentary accessories, can also enhance perceived value and encourage customer loyalty</li>



<li><strong>Reverse features:</strong> These are features that cause dissatisfaction and are often considered undesirable. For example, complex visual formatting in an instruction manual may frustrate customers who prefer a straightforward, step-by-step text format</li>
</ul>



<p>Customer responses gathered through surveys help classify the feature into one of the Kano Model&#8217;s categories, guiding product decisions intended to satisfy customers.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-survey-methodology-for-the-kano-model-"><strong>Survey Methodology for the Kano Model</strong></h2>



<p>Creating a Kano Model survey helps capture and understand customer expectations, perceptions, and needs, enhancing the <a href="/blog?p=174226">customer-centricity</a> of your products.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-how-to-design-a-kano-model-survey">How to design a Kano Model survey</h3>



<p>To design the survey questionnaire, brainstorm and select the features you want to assess.</p>



<p>For every feature, ask the target audience two sets of questions:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Functional question</strong>: How would you feel if this feature were present in product X?</li>



<li><strong>Dysfunctional question</strong>: How would you feel if this feature were absent from product X?</li>
</ul>



<p>Provide a set range of responses for both questions:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>I like it</li>



<li>I expect it</li>



<li>I am neutral</li>



<li>I can tolerate it</li>



<li>I dislike it</li>
</ul>



<p>After creating the survey, send it to your team for pilot testing to identify any unclear or ambiguous language. Address these issues, then distribute the final questionnaire to your target audience via email, social media, and other channels.</p>



<p>Follow effective <a href="/blog?p=148840">customer management strategies</a> to increase survey participation and engagement. This will help ensure your survey accurately captures customer preferences that maximize customer delight.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-evaluating-responses-from-the-kano-model-questionnaire">Evaluating responses from the Kano Model questionnaire</h3>



<p>After collecting customer responses, the next crucial step is to analyze and evaluate them.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s how you can do it:</p>



<p><strong>Step 1: Categorize individual responses: </strong>Analyze the combination of answers from each participant for both functional and dysfunctional questions. Use the table below to classify the responses for each feature</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Functional</strong></td><td></td><td><strong>Dysfunctional</strong></td><td></td><td><strong>Category</strong></td></tr><tr><td>I expect it</td><td>+</td><td>I dislike it</td><td>→</td><td>Must-have</td></tr><tr><td>I like it</td><td>+</td><td>I dislike it</td><td>→</td><td>Performance</td></tr><tr><td>I like it</td><td>+</td><td>I am neutral</td><td>→</td><td>Attractive</td></tr><tr><td>I am neutral</td><td>+</td><td>I am neutral</td><td>→</td><td>Indifferent</td></tr><tr><td>I dislike it</td><td>+</td><td>I expect it</td><td>→</td><td>Reverse</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Let&#8217;s look at an example to understand the table above: say you&#8217;re designing a new car. If most drivers expect airbags (<strong>functional</strong>) and dislike not having them (<strong>dysfunctional</strong>), airbags are a <strong>must-have</strong> feature—they are essential. This table shows the categories that are the result of the combination of the functional and dysfunctional responses.</p>



<p><strong>Note:</strong> If a participant provides an illogical or inconsistent answer, such as &#8216;I like it&#8217; for both functional and dysfunctional questions, classify the response under the special category &#8216;questionable.&#8217;</p>



<p><strong>Step 2: Conduct aggregate analysis: </strong>After categorizing individual responses, create a summary table to consolidate the data. For each feature, calculate the percentage of responses in each category relative to the total responses. This analysis will help you understand the relative position of feature categories</p>



<p><strong>Step 3: Identify the final category for each feature:</strong> After calculating the percentages for each category, determine the category with the highest percentage for each feature. Create a column labeled &#8216;Result/Final Feature Category&#8217; and list the category with the highest percentage for each feature</p>



<p>To make evaluating responses easier, consider using productivity tools that simplify data analysis and streamline the process. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="6-use-cases-and-examples-of-the-kano-model-"><strong>Use Cases and Examples of the Kano Model</strong></h2>



<p>The Kano Model survey is particularly useful for projects with tight deadlines or limited budgets. It helps you pinpoint which features to prioritize to create a product or service that impresses and satisfies customers.</p>



<p>Here are several contexts and scenarios where the Kano model is beneficial:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="7-product-feature-development-"><strong>Product feature development</strong></h3>



<p>The Kano Model assists <a href="/blog?p=134648">product discovery</a> and development teams create feature-rich products that customers expect. For instance, if a company is developing a new smartwatch, the Kano Model survey helps distinguish between essential features (such as heart rate monitoring) and those that can offer a competitive advantage (like sleep tracking and stress management features).</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="8-marketing-campaigns-"><strong>Marketing campaigns</strong></h3>



<p>Marketing teams can use the Kano Model to design targeted campaigns that align with customer preferences.</p>



<p>For example, when launching a new home appliance, the model helps identify standout features (such as a unique voice command system or an in-built recipe assistant) that can be emphasized in advertisements and promotions to generate buzz, create excitement, and boost the product’s market appeal.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="9-product-evaluation-and-improvement-"><strong>Product evaluation and improvement</strong></h3>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="13-addressing-the-limitations-of-the-kano-model-"><strong>Addressing the Limitations of the Kano Model</strong></h2>



<p>The Kano Model is a powerful tool for understanding customer needs and preferences, but it does have some limitations that can impact its effectiveness.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s a closer look at these challenges:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Time-consuming research: </strong>Using the Kano Model effectively requires identifying and defining a range of potential features. This necessitates thorough market, competitor, and customer research. Conducting this research can be time-consuming and resource-intensive, as it demands a deep understanding of what features are relevant and valuable to your audience</li>



<li><strong>Respondent fatigue: </strong>The Kano Model survey can become lengthy and burdensome for respondents, especially when evaluating numerous features. This fatigue can lead to disengagement and diminished quality of responses, which affects the reliability of the data collected</li>



<li><strong>Complex analysis: </strong>Interpreting the results of a Kano survey involves sorting through detailed responses and categorizing features into basic, performance, and excitement attributes. This analysis can be complex, particularly with large datasets, and requires a nuanced understanding of the model to derive meaningful insights</li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s how you can address these limitations:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Combine research methods</strong>: Use the Kano Model alongside qualitative methods like interviews and focus groups. This approach provides deeper insights into customer needs and helps identify key features without extensive pre-survey research</li>



<li><strong>Apply adaptive survey techniques: </strong>Limit the number of features in the survey or use adaptive techniques to focus on the most important ones. This reduces respondent fatigue and contributes to more effective quality management</li>



<li><strong>Utilize data analysis tools:</strong> Use productivity tools like ClickUp to streamline and speed up the analysis of survey responses. This way, you can efficiently manage and interpret data, ensuring timely and accurate insights for your decision-making</li>
</ul>
